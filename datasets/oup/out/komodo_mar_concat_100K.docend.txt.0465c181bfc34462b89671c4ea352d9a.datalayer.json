    "text": "NEW DELHI : Inderjeet Singh was killed by toxic gases in a sewer 18 months ago . His mother , 62-year-old Maya Kaur , remembered trying to dissuade him to continuing in this line of work but being asked where the food would come from . On Thursday , Kaur could answer that question on how they could survive without manual scavenging . Kaur , smartly attired in a polka-dotted blue sari and white helmet , was one of the 200 recipients of a Rs 35-lakh scavenging machine . As a contractor , she can now earn a living without endangering anyone 's life . While prioritising who should get the blue-and-white motorised sewer-cleaning machines , DJB preferred families whose members had perished in the job and those belonging to the SC community . The first lot of 200 , accordingly , consisted of eight families of sewer victims , 46 manual scavengers , 92 men and 46 women from the SC community , and eight women from the general category . DJB will guarantee these new contractors the cleaning of 500 metres of sewer lines every day . Sitting near Kaur was Renu Devi . Her brother died while cleaning a sewer in Chhatarpur a year and a half ago , and Thursday signified a turnaround for the finance-strapped family . \" I distinctly remember asking him to have some milk before rushing off for work that fateful day , \" Devi said . \" I did not give birth to him , but in everything else , he was like my own son . \" Devi 's husband is employed as a security guard , but it is she who will now don the mantle of the family 's financial head . She will also have her two sons as 'em ployees ' . Priti , who goes by just one name , was among the youngest beneficiaries . The 23-year-old lost her husband , Mohan , in last year 's much publicised Lajpat Nagar case . \" Since then , I have been working with the civil defence , but my income was n't enough to ensure proper care of my two children , \" she said , hopeful now of a better future . The male beneficiaries were no less optimistic . Deepak Kheriwal , an SC contractor from Shahdara , was all praise for the scheme . \" This new business model can help us to become self-reliant while providing employment to three others , \" he said . Kheriwal seemed to be echoing Milind Kamble , chairman , Dalit Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry , who said , \" Entrepreneurship is the third path after job reservation and political representation for the uplift of the Dalit community . This scheme is a replicable model for other states . \""

    "text": "March Mindfulness is our new series that examines the explosive growth in mindfulness and meditation technology -- culminating in Mashable 's groundbreaking meditation bracket contest . Because March should n't be all madness . In a culture obsessed with self-care , feeling like you 've failed at the practice of mindfulness can breed unique feelings of frustration , resentment , and even shame . It seems so simple : Quietly observing your thoughts , you remain open to and curious about the present moment without judging the ideas that ping back and forth in your consciousness . You expect to experience the benefits that research says mindfulness can offer , including reduced stress , increased attentional focus , less emotional volatility , and improved relationship satisfaction . Except , for some people , that 's not what happens . They might find it hard to stay in the present moment , feel anxious after attempting mindfulness , and abandon their practice . Such frustration is often rooted in a misunderstanding of how mindfulness works , and what it 's meant to do , say experts . People 's expectations of mindfulness are sometimes far higher than what the tool could ever deliver . \" There 's a lot of hype and buzz around mindfulness , \" says Alex Haley , assistant professor and mindfulness program lead at the University of Minnesota 's Earl E. Bakken Center for Spirituality & Healing . \" [ People think ] everywhere I turn it 's mindfulness-based something . I 'm going to have all these expectations that mindfulness is a cure-all , that it 's a panacea . There are limits to what it 's able to do . \" Those misconceptions can be cleared up with just a little research . Yet there 's another , more complex reason why some people feel mindfulness is n't effective . An emerging field of research is exploring how people who 've experienced trauma may feel significantly worse during or after mindfulness practice . Researchers working to understand that dynamic believe it 's still possible to use mindfulness approaches , just with important modifications . So before giving up on mindfulness , or feeling ashamed that mindfulness is n't producing the results you wanted , make sure you 've considered the following things : Mindfulness has multiple definitions and those can look different depending on your teacher , or whether you 're getting mindfulness tips or instruction from an app , best-selling book , YouTube channel , Instagram influencer , yoga class , or news stories like this one . \" Mindful awareness is paying attention to present moment experiences with openness , curiosity , and a willingness to be . \" Perhaps the most widely-known definition of the secular practice of mindfulness comes from researcher and meditation teacher Jon Kabat-Zinn , who said : \" Mindfulness means paying attention in a particular way : on purpose , in the present moment , and non-judgmentally . \" Though Haley uses Kabat-Zinn 's definition , he frequently invokes another one from Diana Winston , director of mindfulness education at UCLA Semel Institute 's Mindful Awareness Research Center : \" Mindful awareness is paying attention to present moment experiences with openness , curiosity , and a willingness to be with what is . \" J. David Creswell , an associate professor of psychology at Carnegie Mellon University who studies mindfulness , thinks of it as an \" open or present attention to your present situation . \" While different from each other , these definitions share a core element : attention to the present . If you embrace one definition over another , just remember that it 's meant to help you understand how to practice mindfulness , and it 's fine to consider what it might leave out . This approach will help guide your practice and refine your expectations . Creswell says popular misconceptions of mindfulness portray it as a tool for relaxation or \" blissing out . \" \" It 's not unicorns and rainbows , \" he says . \" I liken mindfulness meditation practices to aerobic practices for the brain . [ Exercising ] hurts , it 's a little unpleasant , but at the same time it 's building muscle . With mindfulness , you 're building a brain that 's more resilient . \" That mental strength develops over time as you focus the brain 's attention on the present moment and learn how to observe positive , negative , and neutral feelings without being carried away by any of them . This is no easy task for human beings , whose powerful thoughts and feelings can rip them from the present moment and thrust them into a stream of consciousness that 's confusing , exhilarating , fulfilling , or exhausting . Some people mistake mindfulness as a surefire way to avoid that overwhelming experience , but Creswell says that 's not the case . Developing mindfulness skills can mean , for example , staying observant and curious about what 's happening when you 're having a panic attack . From Creswell 's perspective , the goal is to cultivate \" equanimity \" in the face of uncomfortable experiences . That objective is why mindfulness is so frequently associated with formal , seated meditation , which can prompt physical discomfort and mental fatigue . Haley believes that mindfulness works because it puts people in a different state of mind , one where they 're actively aware of and paying attention to events happening in the present moment . As they take in that information , they better understand the situation and can make a choice about how to respond . With regular practice , this can create a \" positive feedback loop \" that leads to more moments of mindfulness , and our resulting choices become wiser and more compassionate , says Haley . \" It allows us to understand our experiences , and most importantly , is the choice to how we respond to the things we 're feeling , \" says Haley . \" If we notice things that are really challenging , we can say , ' I want to make a different choice . ' \" \" If we notice things that are really challenging , we can say , ' I want to make a different choice . ' \" That sense of agency is empowering , but it 's important to know that mindfulness is a state of mind that comes and goes . Feeling calm and observant one day and at the mercy of your thoughts and emotions the next does n't mean you 've failed at mindfulness . It just presents another opportunity to strengthen your skills , or to try again the following day . Haley says frustration and difficulty with mindfulness can come from overly strict ideas about how to practice it . People commonly believe that mindfulness means you must practice formal , seated meditation , but Haley says that 's just one option . He sometimes recommends people start with movement by observing how their body feels when its been moving for long periods of time . Haley also relies on a slight variation of the \" STOP \" technique in which you slow down , take a breath and extend the exhale , observe what 's happening in the body , and consider the possibilities before proceeding . That approach can shift people into a state of mindfulness and away from being reactive . Creswell 's own research has found that there are three types of evidence-based mindfulness programs : an 8-week mindfulness-based stress reduction course founded by Kabat-Zinn and offered by credentialed instructors around the world ; apps like Headspace and Calm that use teachers trained in mindfulness ; and mindfulness meditation retreats . Creswell recommends exploring various options to find research-backed programming and resources , or a qualified teacher . Despite the clear benefits of mindfulness , science still ca n't say who might benefit most or least from the practice . Creswell says it 'll be five or 10 years before researchers can confidently answer that question . In the meantime , some scientists and meditation practitioners who study mindfulness are focusing on the possibility that mindfulness might actually create the possibility of harm for some people who try it , particularly those with a history of trauma . David Treleaven , author of Trauma-Sensitive Mindfulness : Practices for Safe and Transformative Healing , says that for some people struggling with trauma the basic tenets of mindful meditation practice , including focusing on the breath and remaining still for periods of time , can actually exacerbate trauma symptoms . Paying close attention to anxious or threatening feelings may heighten the body 's fight-or-flight stress response , elicit intrusive thoughts of harm or danger , and prompt flashbacks to traumatic events . For some , focusing on trauma symptoms because they 're happening in the present moment can lead to physical immobilization akin to freezing in place . Treleaven describes that response as a \" deeply wired survival response in humans . \" A meditation teacher unaware of these dynamics might insist that remaining curious and nonjudgmental about these sensations is a necessary part of mindfulness meditation . \" People feel isolated and ashamed that a practice that seems to be working for so many people is n't working for them . \" While Treleaven believes that mindfulness can be very beneficial for people who 've lived through trauma , he disagrees with an approach that diminishes or minimizes their unique experiences . \" People feel isolated and ashamed that a practice that seems to be working for so many people is n't working for them , \" he says . \" They end up feeling like , ' I 'm broken beyond a point that even meditation ca n't work for me . ' \" Treleaven instead advocates for adjustments to mindfulness meditation . He urges people to take breaks as needed instead of pursuing lengthy sessions or weeks-long meditation streaks . He advises teachers against touching students without their explicit permission . If focusing on the breath is anxiety-provoking , Treleaven recommends finding an \" object or anchor of attention , \" like sounds or the feeling of your bottom touching a cushion or the floor . When sitting for long periods of time is uncomfortable for those who 've experienced trauma-related freezing , Treleaven suggests mindfulness that incorporates movement . The goal , he says , is to create a consistent practice that builds mindfulness skills while reducing the risk of harm . He recommends people who 've experienced trauma look for mindfulness resources , classes , and instructors with a trauma-informed approach . \" It does n't need to be a one-size-fits-all practice , \" Treleaven says . \" We can modify it for people so that it enables them to have a sense of success . \" No matter why you 're struggling to feel the benefits of mindfulness , that flexibility is key to starting , continuing , or pausing a practice . Mindfulness , after all , is never about perfection ."

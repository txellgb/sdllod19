    "text": "Going to the 1978 boys hockey state tournament was a great memory for Mike Ramsey . Ramsey 's Minneapolis Roosevelt squad was facing heavily-favored Edina East in the state quarterfinals at the St. Paul Civic Center . Roosevelt went down 2-0 early but battled back to not the game at 2-2 on the strength of two goals Ramsey assisted on . The game seemed destined for overtime , until Steve Ikola -- the son of famed Edina coach Willard Ikola -- scored with less than a minute to play to give Edina East the 3-2 quarterfinal win en route to a state title . But should the goal have counted ? Ramsey and Co. swear the goal was scored via a high stick . \" But there was no replay back then , \" he lamented . Still , Ramsey noted , just playing in the state tournament was \" fantastic . \" It was a fitting end to a senior season in which the defenseman put up 30 goals and 27 assists . \" If we would have done some damage in the state tournament , it would have been an upset , \" said Ramsey , who was one of three defensemen on that team to play Division I hockey . \" We had a really good team , but there was lots of good teams then . \" Ramsey , the No. 5 player on the Pioneer Press countdown of the top 75 players to play Minnesota high school hockey , went on to play for the Gophers -- but not always the varsity team . Ramsey was stuck on the JV squad for about a month of his first season . He was tasked with unseating one of the eight returning varsity lettering defensemen to earn varsity ice time . \" And that took a little bit , \" Ramsey said . In retrospect , such a coaching decision looks foolish , but the coach , Herb Brooks , did n't see it that way . \" He was very proud of how he handled me , \" Ramsey said . \" I did n't think ( it was the right decision ) , but he was very proud . \" Ramsey was on the varsity team by the time the Gophers were winning the national title that spring . And Brooks knew better than to leave Ramsey off the U.S. Olympic team in 1980 , a decision that surprised Ramsey , who thought for sure his young age would eliminate him from the roster . As it turned out , Ramsey was the youngest player on that gold medal-winning team . Ramsey said players knew at the time how big it was to beat the Soviets and go on to win gold , but no one could have guessed what type of staying power the achievement would have . \" I still see highlights and stuff on the Olympics and I 'll tap my wife on the shoulder and say , ' Hey , I 'm in that game , ' \" Ramsey said . \" And she rolls her eyes like ' shut up , ' but I was very fortunate to be a part of that . I still look at it and I can see highlights and I can say , ' Wow . ' That was really cool to be a part of that . \" From there , Ramsey , who was selected 11th overall in the NHL draft by Buffalo in 1979 , started his pro career with the Sabres . Throughout his career to that point , Ramsey was an offensive defenseman . You do n't score 30 goals in high school without a knack for finding the net . \" Back then I was pretty much all over the ice , \" he said . \" You did what you had to do . If you needed goals , you gambled . If you did n't need goals , you stayed back . That was kind of the philosophy . \" That philosophy quickly changed in the pros under head coach Scotty Bowman . \" Bowman chewed me out a few times , \" Ramey said . \" He said he was going to throw a rope around me and tie me to our own net . I said , ' Do you want me to play defense ? ' He said , ' I want you to play just defense . ' I said , ' I can do that . ' About two or three years later , I was labeled a defensive defenseman . I changed my game and kind of settled in and concentrated more on defense . \" Which was fine with Ramsey , who thought it was easier to stop other people from scoring than have to consistently put up points . Ramsey thinks that change in philosophy lengthened his pro career . He played 1,070 games over 17 years , making four all-star teams . Ramsey 's plus-minus was plus-203 for his career . A teammate of Ramsey 's with the Gophers and the Olympic team , Neal Broten said the defenseman \" made all the right plays . \" \" He 's just a smart hockey player , and he was a big kid -- 6-foot-3 , strong in front of the net and the corners , played hard all the time , \" Broten said . \" You could always count on him every game , every practice , whatever . Just someone that , if I was a coach , I 'd want him on my team any second , because you know he 's going to make the right play . \" That 's why Ramsey , now a Chanhassen resident , thinks he stuck around the NHL for so long . \" I always use the word it 's hard to be a good pro , and I thought I was a good pro , \" Ramsey said . \" They knew what they were going to get from me , and they got that most every night . I did n't take a lot of nights off , so I think I was pretty consistent . \" Ramsey is , rightfully , proud of his NHL longevity , but that does n't mean he 'd want to go back and do it again . \" Playing in the NHL for 17 years was awesome , but it was hard , \" Ramsey said . \" I would n't mind making the money they make now , but I would n't want to do that again . I would n't want to do that again . Plus the game was different in the NHL then . Some of the stuff they did back then , you 'd go to jail ( now ) . I do n't think the players have to worry about that . You can still get hurt , but somebody 's not going to sucker punch you or cross check you in the face . ... the game was a little different back in the '80s . \" He also cherishes his NCAA championship and the Olympic gold medal . But if you asked Ramsey which part of his career he would prefer to go back and play again , it would be high school hockey . \" It was just you 're young and you 're with all your buddies you grew up with and played hockey with , and I just thought it was a fabulous time , \" Ramsey said ."

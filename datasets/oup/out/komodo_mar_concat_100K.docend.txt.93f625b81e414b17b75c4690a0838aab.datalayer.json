    "text": "The Young and the Restless recap for Friday , March 1 , brings a twist in Mariah 's witness testimony . Plus , Summer finds out she 's a match to save Lola 's life , but will she do it ? Brittany ( Lauren Woodland ) reminded Sharon ( Sharon Case ) not to be too friendly with Nikki ( Melody Thomas Scott ) and Victoria ( Amelia Heinle ) because her defense depends on it . If Nikki and Victoria do n't take the hit , Sharon will go right down with them . Michael ( Christian LeBlanc ) complained that the Newmans had n't given him much to work with . Then , Nikki told Victoria to stick to Nikki 's original confession story . Christine ( Lauralee Bell ) called Mariah ( Camryn Grimes ) to the stand to discuss the girl 's night at Victoria . Tessa ( Cait Fairbanks ) was in the back of the courtroom supporting Mariah . Mariah described the evening and told what she knew . Christine showed the video of the women putting the rug containing J.T. 's ( Thad Luckinbill ) body in it in the trunk of the car . When Christine finished , Michael cross-examined Mariah and wanted to know the real story of how Mariah first saw the video of the women , which could spell serious trouble for Tessa because of her blackmail scheme against the women . Ana ( Loren Lott ) and Devon ( Bryton James ) talked business , and Kyle ( Michael Mealor ) came by and informed them that Lola 's ( Sasha Calle ) only hope is a liver transplant . Devon offered to help , so he and Ana went to get tested even though it meant Devon had to return to the hospital and face his demons about losing Hilary there . At the hospital , Summer ( Hunter King ) showed up to get tested , and Kyle was rude at first , but then sent her off to find out if she 's a match . Unfortunately for Kyle , he is n't , so all he could do to help is make a playlist for Lola , which Nate ( Brooks Darnell ) encouraged him to play for her . People in a coma can sometimes hear music , and it could help Lola . Summer found out she was a match and asked Nate about the risks of the surgery . According to Inquisitr , she cooks up a devious plan since she holds the key to saving Lola 's life . Elsewhere , Billy ( Jason Thompson ) and Jack ( Peter Bergman ) discussed Phyllis 's ( Gina Tognoni ) role at Jabot and worried that the murder trial would harm the company . Jack told Billy that Kerry ( Alice Hunter ) is devoted to Phyllis , and it would be entirely up to Kerry if she wanted to spy on her boss . When Jack said Kerry is important to him , Billy asked if Kerry was more important to him than Jabot and their family legacy ."

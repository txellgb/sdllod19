    "text": "The ruling hopes to \" profoundly change the way Hollywood does business for many years to come \" . Two years after Bones last aired , the drama 's leads Emily Deschanel and David Boreanaz have been awarded millions of dollars in a game-changing legal case . Deschanel and Boreanaz , along with the series ' executive producer Barry Josephson , have been awarded a sum of more than $ 175 million from Fox , according to Deadline . After first filing lawsuits back in 2015 , both Bones ' stars and its creator have accused Fox of under-reporting the show 's profits and over-charging \" many additional millions of dollars in alleged expenses \" . A recent ruling has now sided with Deschanel , Boreanaz , and Josephson , although Fox has vowed to appeal . Related : Bones ended with an emotional series finale , and fans could n't stop crying In a statement , Barry Josephson 's lawyer said : \" This is a tremendous victory for the Bones profit participants who created and starred in the longest-running drama series to air on the Fox network . It continued : \" After extensive testimony , the arbitrator found that Fox manifests ' a company-wide and accepted climate that envelops an aversion for the truth ' . \" The lawyer acting on behalf of Emily Deschanel , David Boreanaz , and the author of Bones ' source material Kathy Reichs , promised that the recent case will \" profoundly change the way Hollywood does business for many years to come \" . 21st Century Fox , which disagrees with the ruling and is seeking to appeal it , told The Hollywood Reporter that the arbitrator 's decision is \" categorically wrong \" . \" Fox will not allow this flagrant injustice , riddled with errors and gratuitous character attacks , to stand and will vigorously challenge the ruling in a court of law , \" it said ."

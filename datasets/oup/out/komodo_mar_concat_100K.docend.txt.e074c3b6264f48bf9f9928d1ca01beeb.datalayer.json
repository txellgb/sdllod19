From the beginning of the Cubs ' extra-long off-season , Epstein made it clear to all who would listen that the Cubs were not serious players in the Bryce Harper derby . Transparency has been Epstein 's M.O. Transparency has been Epstein 's M.O. from the beginning of his tenure in late 2011 , when he told fans there would be some lean years before the team would contend . from the beginning of his tenure in late 2011 , when he told fans there would be some lean years before the team would contend . Maybe now somebody will believe Chicago Cubs president Theo Epstein . But even though Epstein has that kind of track record , many fans and some media members clung to the notion that somehow , some way , Harper would wind up on the North Side of Chicago . It would have taken something truly extraordinary for that to have happened . In the end , the Philadelphia Phillies are giving Harper an extraordinary contract , a reported 13-year deal worth a reported $ 330 million . Bully for Harper . The Phillies have made sense since before Day 1 of the off-season , and Harper should feast in the Phillies ' hitter-friendly ballpark . His presence should make the Phils the favorites in the National League East and perhaps meet up with the Cubs in the postseason . For the Cubs , the silly season was silly from the beginning . First came the reports that they would be open to trading third baseman Kris Bryant despite about 138 reasons why that makes no sense . The Harper talk did n't stop until Thursday , and in fairness , there 's always a possibility until a deal is done elsewhere . But we 're talking slim possibility . First , whether you buy the Cubs ' company line or not , Epstein and team chairman Tom Ricketts made it clear from the start that money was going to be tight this winter . If the Cubs were to have made a serious run at Harper , they would have had to make other moves . They would either have had to trade right fielder Jason Heyward , who is entering only the fourth season of his weighty eight-year , $ 184 million deal . Even if a trade were possible , the Cubs would had to have eaten a good portion of Heyward 's deal . Not many other teams would want to pick up the bulk of a contract for a two wins-above-replacement player . The silliness continued into spring training . When Heyward was scratched from the Cubs ' lineup earlier this week for personal reasons , speculation started again that he would be traded to make room for Harper . The same thing happened last week when infielder-outfielder Ben Zobrist was an excused absence , also for personal reasons . Even if the Cubs had kept Heyward and signed Harper , they would have had to move Heyward to center field , and where would that have left center fielder Albert Almora Jr . ? Now we can all get on with our business . The Phillies all along have been the ideal landing spot for Harper . The only shame of it all is that the Phillies and Harper did not reach a deal three months ago , allowing the team to use the entire off-season to build a marketing campaign around the player . Even so , expect the presses to start rolling with those Phillies Harper jerseys and for fans in Philly to start lining up for tickets ."

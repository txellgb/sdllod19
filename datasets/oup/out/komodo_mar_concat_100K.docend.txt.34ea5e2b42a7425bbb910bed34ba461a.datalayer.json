    "text": "Paul Pogba is reportedly in line to become Manchester United 's new captain . United skipper Antonio Valencia looks set to leave Old Trafford this summer after 10 years at the club . The 33-year-old was given the armband by Jose Mourinho in the summer , but has managed just eight appearances this season - and a calf complaint has been partly behind why he has made just one start under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer . Valencia hinted late on Friday evening that he is set to exit the club - and Pogba has emerged as the No. 1 candidate to replace him as United captain , according to The Sun . Mourinho took the vice-captaincy off the French midfielder but he has enjoyed a stunning change in fortunes since Solskjaer 's arrival . Pogba has been a regular and chipped in with nine goals as the Red Devils have reignited their top four hopes . His future at Old Trafford looked to be in serious doubt before Mourinho 's departure but it is claimed Solskjaer is ready to hand him the captaincy in the summer . Valencia is believed to have returned to Ecuador as he recovers from his latest injury issue and expects to leave the club after a decade of service . Valencia wrote on Twitter : \" Lago Agrio is a very humble town in Ecuador . When I was a child , I never imagined travel to Europe . Thanks to God for letting me play 10 years in the best club in the world : @ManUtd . \" Now I am focused on my recovery so I can end the season playing at Old Trafford ! \""

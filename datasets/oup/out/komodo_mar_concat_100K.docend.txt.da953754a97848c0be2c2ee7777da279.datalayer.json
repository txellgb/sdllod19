    "text": "CEDAR CITY -- The Cedar High girls basketball team stayed unbeaten on the season with a 52-33 defeat of Stansbury late Thursday evening . The contest , which started at 9:10 p.m. , was the final 4A state basketball game of the day staged at Southern Utah University 's America First Event Center , but the sizable crowd did n't seem to mind the late hour as they showed up in force to cheer on the Lady Reds to their 23rd consecutive victory . Cedar 's trademark defense went on full display in the opening minutes as the Lady Reds jumped to a 16-1 lead . After Stansbury 's first several possessions ended in missed shots or turnovers , guard Kayla Alvey finally hit a 3-pointer from the corner with 1:10 left in the first quarter to give the Lady Stallions their first field goal of the game . Cedar held a commanding 20-4 lead after one quarter , but things slowed down during the second quarter as Stansbury outscored the Lady Reds 8-7 during the stanza to make it 27-12 at the half . \" We thought we 'd put some pressure on them , get them to make some turnovers , and obviously in the first eight , 10 or 12 minutes we did that , \" said Cedar head coach Corry Nielsen . We got out on the break and passed the ball . We shared the ball well . But in the middle of the game , we kind of hit a lull , and it was my fault . I kind of had us back off . I got to keep us always on attack and always full speed ahead . \" Stansbury got as close as 13 points late in the third period , when freshman forward Epa Tia hit a free throw to make it 33-20 . But Cedar guard Japrix Weaver closed out the third with a pair of jump shots to bump the lead back up to 37-20 . Point guard Logann Laws scored Cedar 's first two baskets of the fourth period to give her team a 21-point cushion , and the Lady Reds were able to maintain a 20-point lead or thereabouts the rest of the way . Laws , who led all scorers with 18 points , said after the game she and her teammates were determined to play hard against Stansbury . \" Just focus on this game ahead of us , \" she said , describing her team 's mindset as the game began . Leave it out all on the floor . Nothing matters with this game right here . Just teamwork . \" Joining Laws in scoring in double figures was Weaver , who finished with 13 points . As a team , the Lady Reds showed a tendency to shoot from closer range than usual , making 21 2-point field goals and just two 3-pointers . Stansbury was led by Tia 's 12 points , while senior guard Kalee Philips added 7 . With the victory , Cedar advances to Friday 's semifinals , where they 'll face the Lehi Lady Pioneers at 2:30 p.m. , also at SUU . Lehi came from behind in the final minutes to defeat Green Canyon 58-55 in its quarterfinal game Thursday night , right before the Cedar vs. Stansbury matchup . \" Lehi 's a very good team , \" coach Nielsen said ."

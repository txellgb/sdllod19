    "text": "In our second MCU revisit , we look back at the Hulk 's only solo movie - a creative tussle between Marvel and their leading man This article contains spoilers for The Incredible Hulk and the wider MCU . The Hulk is easily one of the greatest superhero creations that Stan Lee and Jack Kirby ever conceived . The mixture of elements - Godzilla meets Frankenstein meets Jekyll and Hyde - resulted in a versatile , engaging and visually exciting character that fans ( and the Hulk himself ) love to describe as \" the strongest one there is \" . Louis Leterrier 's 2008 movie , The Incredible Hulk , was the last time the Hulk 's world was brought to the screen as a solo consideration , and to this day it remains an oddity in the Marvel Cinematic Universe despite being its second instalment . Indeed , until the return of William Hurt 's General Ross in 2016 's Captain America : Civil War , no actor introduced in it had reprised their role for future movies - almost baffling for a series built on its internal continuity . The reasons for this are varied , but primarily we can point to the film 's tepid reception . Co-produced by Marvel Studios and Universal , the movie was also the subject of a public dispute between its bosses and lead actor Ed Norton , who rewrote the script and had severe disagreements on the nature of the final cut . He remained open to returning for a while , but eventually , he and Marvel decided that the relationship was over and he was replaced with Mark Ruffalo in the role for Avengers Assemble and beyond . This was n't necessarily a terrible thing . Although a fan-favourite at the time of his casting , the movie itself painted a different picture . Norton 's restrained , almost detached performance lacks the manic twitch of Ruffalo 's . It 's notionally the same Bruce Banner , but it might as well not be . Oddly , the MCU Hulk never received much of an origin . Coming just five years after Ang Lee 's ambitious-but-confusing Hulk , Leterrier and co positioned their movie as a sort-of-sequel that sat tenuously alongside the former . If you squinted a little anyway . Aside from flashes of an accident during the intro , the MCU Hulk arrived fully-formed , unburdened by an origin story . It can be hard to remember the days before everyone was a walking Marvel handbook who could list every Infinity Stone and all of the Nine Realms , but by virtue of a fantastically popular TV show in the '70s , the Hulk was one of the few Marvel characters to penetrate pop-culture to any significant extent . Certainly an order of magnitude above the likes of Iron Man , Captain America and Thor . The movie did its best to capitalise on that , drawing its morose tone from the TV show . Although packed with Easter eggs , it 's a far different experience from watching a modern MCU movie . The humour , in particular , is missing - Modern Family 's Ty Burrell turns up as Doc Samson and flexes precisely none of the comedic chops he 's now known for . It 's hard to say what the film 's primary failing is . The action is good , but the CGI is n't . The characters are strong , but the performances maybe are n't . The love story between Bruce and Betty ( Liv Tyler ) might well be one of the MCU 's better attempts at romance , but only because the competition elsewhere is weak . The key relationship - the love/hate triangle between General Ross , Betty Ross and Bruce never quite becomes the thematic centre it should have been . Meanwhile , Tim Roth 's Blonsky and Tim Brooke-Taylor 's Sterns prove inadequate narrative drivers as villains , and when Doc Samson turns up as Betty 's nice-guy partner who immediately sides with her and Bruce against her father , it 's tough to feel invested in a love story that 'll break him and her up . Ultimately , though , it 's the climax where the film falls apart . The Harlem fight is n't a total flop , but as soon as Bruce makes the decision to turn back into the Hulk , it 's basically a computer game cutscene with a foregone conclusion . Hulk is , after all , the strongest one there is . Just not in a narrative sense . Standout scene : At Culver University , the army corners Banner to force his transformation , leading directly into a fight with the powered-up ( but not yet abominable ) Blonsky . Hulk , naturally , smashes his way through assailants in a particularly crowd-pleasing manner , though the moment that really lands is when he saves Betty from Ross ' hubris , demonstrating who the real monster is . This one scene shows off all that 's great about the Hulk : the anxiety of Banner 's change , the invincible , unstoppable rage of a Hulk fighting for his life , and the tragic pathos of his love for Betty . Best quip : Bruce Banner ( in broken Portuguese ) : \" Do n't make me ... hungry . You would n't like me when I 'm ... hungry . \" One of the few genuine jokes in a film that is extremely light on comedy - especially by the standards of a modern MCU movie . First appearances : Bruce Banner and General Ross are the only two characters who appear in the franchise again , though obviously Bruce Banner is recast by the time he comes back for Avengers Assemble . Hurt recurs as ( now-Secretary ) Ross in both Captain America : Civil War and Avengers : Infinity War . It seems fitting - after all , the General is a big fan of wars . So long , farewell : No-one actually dies in this movie , but you can bid a fond ( or possibly not-so-fond ) farewell to Liv Tyler 's Betty Ross , Tim Roth 's Abomination and Tim Brooke-Taylor 's Samuel Sterns , none of whom have returned to the franchise despite being integral characters within the Hulk 's personal mythos . A particularly sad state of affairs for fans of The Leader , with Sterns ' transformation into the big-brained super-genius hinted at here but never subsequently followed up on-screen . It 's all connected : The Incredible Hulk is arguably the MCU 's least connected movie , to the point where some people question its canonicity outright . But it 's not completely off the grid : * The serum that transformed Banner into the Hulk is described as an attempt to recreate a past super-soldier programme . That program is , of course , Project Rebirth , which we see succeeding ( just the once ) on Steve Rogers in Captain America : The First Avenger . The cannister of serum used even contains the name \" Erskine \" as in Abraham Erskine , who wo n't be seen on screen until 2011 , three years after this movie 's release . * The Hulk 's fight with the Abomination in Harlem is mentioned multiple times in subsequent films and the MCU 's TV shows , where it remains ( understandably ) a major part of the public 's perception of super-powered individuals . * The finale of the film shows a version of Banner whose transformations are now , at least on some level , under control . In Avengers Assemble , Bruce famously reveals his secret . He 's always angry , and his transformation into the Hulk can indeed be triggered painlessly and at will - if he 's happy to do it . Credit check : \" You should talk . \" \" You should listen . \" There 's a case to be made that this meeting of Tony Stark and General Ross - two characters from different movies - is actually the birth of the MCU proper . Surprising , given that it was a hastily added and completely improvised scene designed to capitalise on the excitement that Iron Man 's tag scene had created earlier in the year . Indeed , this lack of planning actually created a continuity problem ( why would Stark be inviting General Ross to get involved with the Avengers programme ? ) that was later cleared up in one of the sadly-departed Marvel One-Shot movies . It revealed that Stark was sent to invite Ross to the Avengers specifically because SHIELD felt that he 'd annoy the military man into turning them down ."

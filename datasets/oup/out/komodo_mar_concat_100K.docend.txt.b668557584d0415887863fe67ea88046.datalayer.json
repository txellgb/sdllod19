    "text": "Following Tesla 's launch of the highly-anticipated $ 35,000 Standard Model 3 , the electric car maker has implemented price adjustments for its flagship Model S and Model X line . With the recent reductions in place , versions of the Model S and X now cost up to $ 18,000 less than their previous prices . Accessing the order page for the Model S , customers will see that the vehicle is offered in three variants -- Standard , Long Range , and Performance . The Standard Range Model S starts at $ 79,000 and is capable of traveling 270 miles per charge . The vehicle has a 0-60 mph time of 4.2 seconds and a top speed of 140 mph . Despite its range , it should be noted that this Model S variant is equipped with a software-limited battery pack , the capacity of which is yet to be revealed by Tesla . The Long Range Model S , which costs $ 83,000 has a range of 335 miles per charge , has a 0-60 mph time of 4.1 seconds and a top speed of 155 mph . This variant , dubbed the \" Extended Range Model S \" prior to the recent adjustments , started at $ 93,000 . Lastly , the Model S Performance has a range of 315 miles per charge , a 0-60 mph time of 3.0 seconds , a top speed of 155 mph , and a starting price of $ 99,000 , a notable reduction over its previous price of $ 112,000 . Customers who prefer to experience the car 's ferocity can add the Ludicrous Mode upgrade for $ 15,000 , which reduces the 0-60 mph time to 2.4 seconds . With the Ludicrous Mode upgrade , the Tesla Model S Performance now starts at $ 114,000 , a whopping $ 18,000 less than its previous price of $ 132,000 . The Tesla Model X does not have a Standard range option . Instead , the all-electric SUV is only offered as a Long Range or a Performance variant . The Long Range Model X , which has a 295-mile range , a top speed of 155 mph , and a 0-60 mph time of 4.7 seconds , currently costs $ 88,000 . This is $ 8,000 less than its previous price of $ 96,000 . The Model X Performace , which has 289 miles of range , a top speed of 155 mph , and a 0-60 mph time of 3.5 seconds , starts at $ 104,000 , a full $ 13,000 less than its previous price of $ 117,000 . With Ludicrous Mode , which lowers the Model X Performance 's 0-60 mph time to just 2.8 seconds , the Model X Performance now starts at $ 119,000 , $ 18,000 less than its previous price of $ 137,000 . Tesla 's new pricing strategy is notably aggressive . The Model S and Model X have always been costly vehicles , but after these adjustments , they have become far more attainable for a much larger demographic . Coupled with the release of the $ 35,000 Model 3 , Tesla 's reduced prices for the Model S and X give potential customers an option for practically every price bracket . Based on a blog post announcing the new Model 3 variants , Tesla explained that it was able to reduce the costs of its vehicles by shifting all of its sales to an online-only model moving forward . This would allow Tesla to sell in every state in the United States , but it will likely result in yet another round of layoffs as the company closes \" many \" of its stores . Tesla has pledged to significantly increase its service fleet as well , in order to accommodate the influx of vehicles that will be added in the near future . Tesla lowers Model S and Model X price , standardizes battery pack strategy"

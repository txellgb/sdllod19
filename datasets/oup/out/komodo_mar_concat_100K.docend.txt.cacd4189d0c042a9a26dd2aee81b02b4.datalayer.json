    "text": "Android lite apps are the way to go if normal apps ' features may be hard to use , or hard on your phone 's performance . Lite apps are not necessarily being introduced for phones with low memory but they are also meant for countries which have users that experience low bandwidth internet connectivity . Nearly all the popular Android apps have rolled out their stripped-down app versions of their man Apps . Here are some of the popular lightweight apps for Android . Facebook Lite - Memory : Under 5MB Facebook Lite is a stripped version of Facebook for Android . Its designed for places 2G networks and phones with low memory . The lite app loads faster because of the clean interface and minimal features . When I use the app , I 'm reminded of the time when Facebook was available for feature phones . In order to deal with the people using lower-end and obsolete phones , Facebook released a stripped version of Messenger . Messenger Lite is a great app allowing you to chat with all your Facebook profile friends and send stickers to others . I guess , the biggest miss of the app is the non-availability of voice calls . So the app only allows you to do the basic chatting . Just scrolling through your feed in the Twitter App uses a lot of data and causes hiccups on slower phones . So last year , Twitter launched the lightweight official version of the Twitter App called Twitter Lite . This official Twitter Lite is fast , consume less data and loads fast on 2G and 3G networks . It 's a Progressive Web App , so it works by using the Chrome engine but looks and works like a normal app . This lite version is small enough to allow you to save space on your phone and download it quickly . It is also made with a lighter functionality as there 's no messaging nor the ability to upload videos yet while it lets you filter and post photos to the feed or Stories , watch Stories , and browse the Explore page . YouTube Go has been released to optimize the experience of users with limited speed . Video downloading , offline view and data saving features is what you get when you use YouTube Go . NB : Although I have inserted download links that lead to Google Playstore ( for Android devices ) , the apps are also available on the App store ( for iOS ) devices ."

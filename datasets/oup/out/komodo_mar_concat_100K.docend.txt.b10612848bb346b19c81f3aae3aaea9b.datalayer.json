    "text": "The international stories making headlines around the world in the past 24 hours . A second summit between the United States and North Korea has ended without any agreement being reached regarding denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula . The two sides gave conflicting accounts of what led to the failure , with the US President , Donald Trump saying he had walked away because of unacceptable North Korean demands to lift all sanctions . However , North Korea 's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country had sought only a partial lifting of sanctions and had offered a realistic proposal , including the dismantling of its main nuclear site at Yongbyon . Washington insists that dialogue with Pyongyang will continue and the collapse of the Hanoi summit is not a major disappointment . The Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said the pilot would be released tomorrow , to the relief of many Indians , even as his military reported that four Pakistani civilians had been killed by India firing across the disputed border in Kashmir . War crimes accusations are being levelled at Israel after its snipers targetted people identifiable as children , health workers and journalists during protests in Gaza last year . A United Nations commission of inquiry investigated the killing of 189 Palestinians between 30 March and 31 December 2018 . The prime minister is alleged to have accepted gifts from wealthy businessmen and dispensed favours to try to get more positive press coverage . Mr Netanyahu denied the charges and in a defiant broadcast , he repeated his assertion that he is the victim of a left-wing \" witch-hunt \" intended to topple him ahead of the closely contested election on 9 April ."

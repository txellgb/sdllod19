    "text": "The importance of women having financial independence can not be overstated . It is the number one reason women stay in an abusive relationship as they would not be able to support themselves or their children outside of it . As a working woman myself , I am earnest in my efforts in encouraging other women to earn and manage their own money . At the same time , there is a difference between encouraging women to work and shaming them if they choose not to . I see women being called lazy , being a burden or having wasted their education if they do not work . While any of those descriptions can be true for an individual ( women and men ) , it can not be used to broad-brush an extremely complex socio-economic phenomenon . In Bangladesh , a woman is expected to do academically well . However , as soon as she nears graduation most families will prioritise her marriage while her male peers will prioritise landing a first job . Women are not easily allowed to leave the parental home for work . She is expected to follow around her spouse for his career thus making it hard to build her own . We raise our girls to prioritise family for 20 + years but suddenly expect them to behave differently when trends change . A married woman will work equal hours as her male peers and then return home to take care of the household . In addition to caring for children , women are also expected to take care of aging parents on both sides . Not to mention , there are families whose children may have special needs . To shame such a mother as being \" lazy \" or \" wasting her education \" is cruel . When a child comes into the picture , costs go up significantly for a family . Hire extra help , shuttle the children back and forth between family members , and -- for those who can afford it all -- the cost of day care . These costs may eat up a significant portion of what a woman may be earning . She may end up quitting her job because it just does n't make economic sense to work . Our workplaces were designed by men for men who had a stay-at-home wife to take care of the home . In that world , we are trying to fit the needs of women who do not have a husband at home to cook dinner and certainly can not birth and nurse babies . Flexibility is one of the things that helps retain women at work -- hours , location , maternity leave . Workplaces are barely catching up with the need to ensure maternity leave let alone flexible working hours . Shaming caregiving as a cop-out discourages men from being involved in it . If anything , we need to reverse the narrative . We need to elevate caregiving to the prestige of \" working in an office \" so that men want to devote hours to the family instead of their corporate overlords . I am a working woman and I recognise all the privilege that allows me to be one . I was raised by a family where most women worked thus it was n't difficult for me to imagine a career of my own . No one pressured me to get married . With a young daughter , my husband and I rely heavily on both sets of grandparents to look after her . We have the financial means to hire extra help as needed . Most women do not have these privileges . Those who preach hopefully will pause to check their own privilege before telling a woman that she needs to go out and work . It seems , as a woman you are damned if you do and damned if you do n't ."

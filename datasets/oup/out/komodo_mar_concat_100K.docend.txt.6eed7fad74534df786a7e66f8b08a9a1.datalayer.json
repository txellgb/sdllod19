    "text": "Denis Odoi fears Fulham will lose star players such as Aleksandar Mitrovic and Ryan Sessegnon if they drop out of the Premier League . Fulham are staring down the barrel of relegation and yesterday sacked manager Claudio Ranieri , who was only appointed in November . Relegation would not only be a hammer blow to Fulham financially , but it could also have a huge impact on their current squad and Belgian defender Odoi said : \" ' Mitro ' has shown that he has quality to play in the Premier League and there are going to be teams that are interested in him , while ' Sess ' has shown he is a promising , talented footballer , so obviously teams are looking at him . \" It is what it is , but if players leave , hopefully we get others that have quality . \" Sessegnon is still yet to sign a new deal and will have 12 months to run on his contract in the summer , while Mitrovic is likely to attract strong interest after scoring 10 Premier League goals this season ."

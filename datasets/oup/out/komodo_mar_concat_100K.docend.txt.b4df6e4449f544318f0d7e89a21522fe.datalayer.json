    "text": "Chappers is confident he could be the one to take home the Sun Racing Stayers ' crown FAUGHEEN is once again back in full working order - and I 'm already close to orgasms with the thought of him spitting out the opposition in the Sun Racing Stayers ' Hurdle a week on Thursday . In many ways it would be fairytale stuff if Faugheen could roll back the years over a trip he 's never run over at Cheltenham before . But the Sport of Kings - and National Hunt racing in particular - is made for dreaming . Faugheen is one of the most magnificent beasts I have ever seen jump an obstacle . He 's all man . But like many top sportsmen over the years , as he 's got older he 's had his issues . There have still been moments of genius , but alas equally occasions when many have suggested enough is enough . Trained by Ireland 's champion Willie Mullins , Faugheen is now eleven years old . But he 's lightly raced , with a career record of twenty runs and fourteen wins . There 's also been the odd knockout . Class-wise , however , there is nothing to touch him in the Sun Racing 's big event . I was lucky enough to do a Cheltenham preview night with Ruby Walsh on Thursday evening , and it 's fair to say when it came to Faugheen we both filled each other with confidence . And there is every reason to be confident . When last seen , Walsh was looking round for dangers as Faugheen chased Apple 's Jade in the Christmas Hurdle at Leopardstown . Unfortunately a few strides later Faugheen took a crashing fall , and what the result would have been remains open to speculation . I am in no doubt he would have picked up the Gigginstown runner , who was just being niggled at the time . Walsh , though , is not one of them . Remember it was less than a year ago that Faugheen destroyed the 2018 Stayers ' victor Penhill at Punchestown . Admittedly he was given an easy lead that day , but it still showed that the engine burns bright . Paisley Park will be a serious opponent , and Emma Lavelle 's stable star has the ideal racing style for the Stayers ' and he can sit just about anywhere in the race ready to pounce under Aidan Coleman . But he 'll have to be on top of his game to pick up a strong-galloping Faugheen on the front end . It 's between the two for me , as I would be disappointed if Supasundae was good enough or Samcro bounced back to his best . Indeed , I 'm not now even sure his best would be enough in any case . A few weeks ago the Stayers ' looked a pretty tame contest . But that 's much spice in there now and it will be much bigger than the Ryanair on the same day which is just how it should be . Incidentally , news on my travels is that last year 's exciting Champion Bumper victor Relegate is very unlikely to be in action at Cheltenham . Do n't back her . I think she will be back in action later in the season . It 's a shame that over the last week we have lost some big players in Le Richebourg ( Arkle ) and Penhill , who is unable to defend his Stayers ' crown . Fusil Raffles , so impressive at Kempton last weekend , is also very unlikely in the Triumph , while Verdana Blue suffered a shock defeat on the all-weather at Kempton . Thankfully , Buveur d'Air , Altior and Native River are all primed to defend their titles and defending champions are so important to give a line on the previous year . Sir Erec and Benie des Dieux appear the bankers of the week . It 's all go leading up to Cheltenham . I did a Cheltenham preview in London and Dublin this week , and am heading back to Ireland for another in Limerick on Sunday and then to the Goat pub for Attheraces on Tuesday . There 's also a Sun Racing preview evening on Thursday so it 's very much exciting times . The constant chatting really does keep one in the mood and on one 's toes . That 's also good news for my diet , which has been ongoing for about five weeks now with March 17 the end date . As some of you will know , I started on 14st 10lb and at the last check was 13st 5lb . I have a target of 13st , and no less , otherwise people will start to think I 'm ill rather than super fit ! Let 's just hope Faugheen is as toned come Sun Racing Stayers ' day a week on Thursday . Everyone wants the machine in full working order ."

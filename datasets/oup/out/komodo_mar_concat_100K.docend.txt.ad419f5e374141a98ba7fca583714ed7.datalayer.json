    "text": "A brand new trailer has been released for the upcoming Pokemon : Mewtwo Strikes Back Evolution CGI movie The first movie in the Pokemon movie franchise has been recreated in gorgeous CGI . The movie which is planned to release quite soon has received a new teaser trailer . Two brand new teaser trailers have been released onto the official Pokemon YouTube Channel . The first is a 30 second teaser trailer showing Ash , Misty , Brock , Pikachu and a bunch of other Pokemon in glorious CGI . It is quite strange to see originally anime characters rendered in cartoony 3D , I 'm not quite sure if I like it or not . At the moment ' Pokemon : Mewtwo Strikes Back Evolution ' is planned for release in theaters in Japan on July 12th , 2019 . Unfortunately there has been no mention of a release in the West , but judging by the popularity Pokemon has over in the West we should see a re-release of the movie dubbed for Western theatres . Well , hopefully we will as I 'm sure many Western Pokemon fans would be disappointed if we did n't . Check out the first trailer for ' Pokemon : Mewtwo Strikes Back Evolution ' here ."

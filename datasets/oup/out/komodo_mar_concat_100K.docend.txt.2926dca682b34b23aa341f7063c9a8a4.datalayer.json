    "text": "A Los Angeles judge has issued a jail cell \" extraction order \" to force Australian man Shaun Haywood to appear in court to face charges he attempted to murder a security guard outside supermodel Miranda Kerr 's Malibu home . Haywood , a 31-year-old former boxer from the NSW Central Coast , has been locked up in LA jails and mental facilities on $ US1 .05 million bail since his arrest outside the supermodel 's home on October 14 , 2016 . Haywood was scheduled to appear in LA 's Superior Court on Friday but Judge Alan Schneider was told Haywood refused to leave his cell in the Twin Towers Correctional Facility . The judge said it was not the first time Haywood was a court no-show . \" The court really has no alternative but to issue an extraction order for the defendant for the next court date , \" Judge Schneider told the court . A prison extraction team would forcibly remove Haywood from his cell if he refuses to be transported for Wednesday 's next court date . At a January hearing the judge noted Haywood was frustrated with the slow-moving case . Haywood has been charged with attempted murder , aggravated mayhem and assault with a deadly weapon . Haywood was declared fit to stand trial last September after concerns about his mental state , but his lawyer indicated Haywood would enter not guilty pleas by reason of insanity . He could spend the rest of his life locked up in the California hospital system if found guilty of the charges if he pursues an insanity claim . Authorities allege Haywood , who had not met Kerr , went to the Australian supermodel 's home in 2016 to deliver a letter to her . Kerr and her young son Flynn were not home at the time of the incident . A violent struggle erupted when a security guard confronted Haywood outside the house , authorities alleged ."

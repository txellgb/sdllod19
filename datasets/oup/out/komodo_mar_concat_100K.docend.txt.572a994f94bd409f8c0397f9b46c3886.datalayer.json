    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - Lyft Inc inched closer to becoming the first ride-hailing company to make a stock market debut by releasing its filing for an initial public offering on Friday , revealing to the public a detailed look at its financial performance . Fast-growing but money-losing Lyft expects to be valued at up to $ 25 billion in its IPO , sources have said . It is now all but certain to go public before larger but also unprofitable rival Uber Technologies Inc in a test of how investors value the ride-hailing industry . The 220-page document provides a picture of a company with high growth and improving economics but widening losses . Lyft now has nearly 40 percent of the U.S. ride-sharing market , but warned further growth could come at the expense of yet more losses for a company already deep in the red , according to the filing . The company has managed to grab market share from better-funded Uber , but the filing failed to provide answers to how it will sustain growth or achieve profitability . \" We will see how they perform as they have to start filing quarterly and managing shareholder expectations , \" said Alex Castelli , managing partner of emerging markets for advisory and accounting firm CohnReznick . \" Can you achieve the growth expectations ? Can you continue to grow at the rate that you 've been growing ? That 's going to be the real measurement stick over time . \" Lyft 's revenue was $ 2.16 billion for 2018 , double the previous year and up 528 percent from $ 343 million in 2016 . Gross bookings , or the total value of the rides Lyft sells before driver pay is deducted , reached $ 8.05 billion last year , 76 percent above the prior year and 323 percent above 2016 . But Lyft posted a loss of $ 911 million for 2018 , which climbed from $ 688 million in 2017 and $ 682 million in 2016 , according to the filing . Losses could mount , Lyft cautioned , as it continues to invest and eye a broader international expansion . And even now , seven years after it launched , Lyft subsidizes rides to attract passengers and offers bonuses to enlist drivers . Still , Lyft has improved its contribution margin to 43 percent in 2018 from 38 percent in 2017 , a sign the business is getting more efficient . Uber in 2018 lost $ 1.8 billion before taxes , depreciation and other expenses . Its revenue for the year was $ 11.3 billion and ride bookings were $ 50 billion . Lyft 's IPO is being led by JPMorgan Chase & Co. , Credit Suisse Group AG and Jefferies Financial Group Inc . San Francisco-based Lyft is positioned to become the first IPO from a group of highly valued , venture-backed companies including Pinterest and Slack expected go public this year . Lyft expects to be valued at between $ 20 billion and $ 25 billion , up from its current $ 15 billion valuation , sources have told Reuters . Lyft plans to launch its two-week roadshow to pitch potential investors the week of March 18 , setting up the company for an early April debut . At a $ 25 billion valuation , Lyft would be trading at nearly 12 times its annual revenue . The same multiple would suggest a roughly $ 135 billion valuation for Uber , whose IPO is likely still several weeks out . Lyft has been eager to emphasize its growth to investors over its total revenue . Lyft said that as of December it held 39 percent of the U.S. ride-hailing market , up from 22 percent at the end of 2016 . The company had 30.7 million riders and 1.9 million drivers in more than 300 U.S. and Canadian cities last year . Lyft earned on average $ 36.04 from each of its 18.6 million active riders during the fourth quarter , a 32 percent increase in earnings and 47 percent increase in riders over the same period in 2017 . Lyft does not expect to make much in the near future on its expansion into bike and scooter renting . Both Uber and Lyft have invested heavily in bikes and scooters as alternatives to car rides for short trips , hopeful that a transportation option that does not involve paying drivers will prove profitable . But Lyft 's acquisition of bike-sharing company Motivate for $ 250.9 million last year is not expected to materially increase revenue in the short term . Revenue from Lyft 's scooter business was also not material . The company 's IPO includes a dual-class stock structure , with one class of shareholders getting 20 votes per share and another getting just one vote per share . Dual-class share structures are increasingly common among technology companies , although Uber got rid of its dual-class stock as part of a broader governance reform . Lyft will offer cash bonuses of up to $ 10,000 to some of its most active drivers with the option to purchase shares in the IPO , a bid to improve relations with drivers . Reuters reported the plan on Thursday . Lyft co-founders Logan Green and John Zimmer each own about 1.2 million shares . The company 's largest shareholder is Rakuten Inc , a Japanese internet company that invested in Lyft in 2015 and made several subsequent investments , and owns a more than 13 percent stake . As a private company , Lyft raised nearly $ 5 billion from investors . Other top shareholders include General Motors Co and Fidelity Investments , with just under 8 percent stakes each ; venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz , which owns more than 6 percent ; and Alphabet Inc , with more than 5 percent of shares ."

    "text": "Almost three years after being indicted on second-degree sexual assault charges , former Baylor defensive end Shawn Oakman was acquitted by jurors in Waco 's 19th State District Court yesterday . Oakman was accused of raping a Baylor graduate student on April 3 , 2016 , at his apartment , an encounter he claimed was consensual . The jury deliberated for two hours before delivering the not guilty verdict . The woman who accused Oakman said that the two had a sexual relationship before the night of April 3 . But when they went back to Oakman 's apartment that night from a nearby bar , she said he would not allow her to leave , instead forcibly removing her clothes and sexually assaulting her twice . The woman testified in court , saying she now has post-traumatic stress disorder , as did two of her best friends saying she was n't the same after what happened . Oakman 's attorneys noted the lack of compelling physical evidence in the case , as well as what the Waco Tribune-Herald called \" conflicting testimony from officers and a nurse about the level of the woman 's impairment . \" Oakman 's case was one of the most prominent in the larger Baylor sexual assault scandal , in which one lawsuit said Baylor football players committed 52 rapes in four years , many of which the administration was accused of covering up . ( Baylor later settled that lawsuit . ) Fellow Baylor defensive ends Tevin Elliott and Sam Ukwuachu were convicted of sexual assault . Ukwuachu is appealing his conviction . Before his indictment in 2016 , Oakman was considered a probable first-round pick in the NFL draft , and he told reporters that he wants to join the league as soon as possible . He spoke about his relief at getting to pursue an NFL career , as well saying the vindication he feels his case should give to the disgraced Baylor football apparatus : Oakman went through the whole legal process , even rejecting a \" generous \" plea deal in December , but to equate his individual acquittal in this particular case with a general vindication for Art Briles , Ken Starr , and all the other administrators who had a hand in covering up and minimizing reports of sexual assault for years would be to dangerously underplay the systemic failures that led to what a student who sued Baylor in 2017 called \" a hunting ground for sexual predators . \" The downfall of the program had nothing to do with some sort of revenge plot by an unnamed \" they \" to \" take down \" Baylor . And it 's bigger than one former player being found not guilty ."

    "text": "What would you be willing to raise your own taxes to pay for ? That 's the question AMOS Iowa posed to Des Moines residents last summer after voters shot down an effort to raise the sales tax in Polk County . What they heard : Better roads , extended library hours , more money to clean up neighborhoods . On Tuesday , voters in six Polk County cities -- Alleman , Altoona , Des Moines , Pleasant Hill , West Des Moines and Windsor Heights -- once again will consider raising the sales tax 1 cent . If approved , the sales tax will go from 6 cents to 7 cents on every dollar spent on taxable goods and services . That would put Des Moines and the other cities in line with the vast majority of the state . Ninety-seven percent of Iowa counties have a 1-cent local-option sales tax . The most recent to adopt the tax was Dallas County in 2017 . Across the six cities , it could bring in an extra $ 48.4 million per year to cut down property taxes and fund city projects . Des Moines alone is expected to get $ 37 million annually from the increase , with half going to the types of projects identified by volunteers last summer . \u25ba IOWA POLL : Most Iowans think property taxes are too high , sales taxes are ' about right ' \" I want to see this pass so we can invest in what we need to in this city , \" said Mel Pins , president of the Somerset Neighborhood Association . \" You can have a great neighborhood , but that one abandoned house on the corner is a blight on the whole neighborhood . \" He 's part of a group encouraging voters to approve the sales tax . It includes neighborhood groups , current and former city council members , the Des Moines firefighters union and local churches . Des Moines would devote the remaining $ 18.5 million to reducing property taxes . The city has vowed to cut the property tax rate 60 cents if the sales tax passes . If it fails , the City Council is ready to vote on a 30-cent property tax rate increase . The 90-cent swing represents about $ 72 per year for the owner of a $ 150,000 home . \u25ba MORE : Des Moines says expect property tax increase if sales tax fails to pass But opponents say a sales tax increase would shift more of the tax burden onto poorer residents -- those less likely to own a home and more likely to spend a greater portion of their money on items that are subject to sales tax . \" Sales taxes hit the poor the hardest , \" said Ed Fallon , a former state lawmaker and a vocal opponent of raising the sales tax . A February Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll found that 55 percent of Iowans view the amount paid in property taxes as too high , while 37 percent think it 's \" about right . \" In contrast , just 21 percent of Iowans view the amount paid in sales taxes as too high , while 71 percent of Iowans think it 's about right . A lot has changed since March 2018 , when voters rejected the last attempt to raise the sales tax in Polk County cities . The Iowa Legislature last session repealed a rule that previously forced Des Moines and \" contiguous \" cities -- those with borders touching Des Moines -- to vote as a bloc . Voters in Des Moines , West Des Moines and Windsor Heights all approved the tax increase last year , but it failed after voters in seven other cities rejected the idea . If Des Moines voters approve the increase and it fails elsewhere , the sales tax will still increase in Des Moines . That 's true in each city voting Tuesday . Altoona Mayor Dean O'Connor said the contiguous rule confused voters last time around . \" It was a little misunderstood , \" he said . Fifty-three percent of Altoona voters rejected the sales tax increase in 2018 . O'Connor is optimistic the change in state law and better outreach this year will be enough to win favor among voters in his town . The Rev. Franklin Gaddy , pastor at St. Paul A.M.E. church in Des Moines , was not involved in the sales tax push last year . He 's active in AMOS Iowa , an advocacy group that 's pushed for expanded mental heath services and affordable housing in the Des Moines metro . Its members come from local religious congregations and nonprofit groups . AMOS Iowa did not officially take a position on the sales tax in 2018 . The group met with Des Moines officials in May and helped craft how the city will spend the sales tax revenue should the measure pass . Several priorities the group identified were incorporated into the city 's plans : Gaddy , whose church is located in the Cheatom Park neighborhood , is particularly interested in the city 's promise to devote more money to removing blighted properties . \" We have a lot of abandoned and dilapidated homes in the community , \" he said , pointing to one stretch of road in his north-side neighborhood that has four crumbling properties . \" How can we get more than 10 houses a year ( the current number Des Moines tackles ) torn down or addressed ? \" he said . AMOS has been involved in an absentee ballot campaign leading up to Tuesday 's vote . Neighbors for Growth and Public Safety , a political action committee , raised $ 282,401 to spend on fliers and other advertising urging residents to vote yes . Its donors include some of Des Moines ' biggest names in construction , real estate and insurance , including Jim Cownie , John Ruan III , Hubbell Realty Co. , Nationwide Insurance and Wellmark , according to records from the Iowa Campaign Ethics Disclosure Board . The group 's chairperson is former Des Moines City Council member Bob Mahaffey . Other groups , including AARP Iowa , the police and fire unions , and the Central Iowa Taxpayers Association , are backing the measure . \u25ba MORE : Pleasant Hill on the hook for big property tax increase if sales tax fails In Pleasant Hill , where 65 percent of voters opposed the sales tax last year , volunteers with the political action committee Good Government for Pleasant Hill have been knocking on doors and passing out flyers . \" We 've hit quite a few homes and have gotten a really positive response , \" said president Sherm Ploeger . \" But you 'll never know until March 6 , or late on March 5 . \" The PAC has had much more time to prepare this year than last year , Ploeger said , but the timing is more urgent this time around . If the vote fails in Pleasant Hill , residents are looking at a 16 percent tax hike , equal to about $ 200 on a $ 200,000 home . It would be the first time Pleasant Hill has raised its tax levy in 20 years . A consistent argument against the imposition of the local-option sales tax is that it 's a regressive tax -- poor people spend a greater share of their income on taxable items compared to wealthier counterparts . A 2015 report from the Institute of Tax and Economic Policy showed that people making less than $ 18,000 a year spend nearly 11 percent of their money on state and local taxes , the highest of any income bracket . \u25ba WANT TO AVOID SALES TAX ? : Buy a gin and tonic , hold everything but the lime . Those who support the tax say that essentials such as groceries , gasoline , prescriptions and medical expenses are exempt from sales tax , lessening the potential impact on the poor . Assuming a family spends about 80 percent of its money in Des Moines and other cities with the 1-cent local sates tax , Iowa State University economist Dave Swenson estimates : And since the poor are often renters , they are the least likely to benefit from lower property taxes . Backers of the sales tax say nearly 34 percent of the money it generates would come from people living outside of Polk County . \" For every $ 3 of new revenue , $ 1 will be paid by those visitors who enjoy the public and civic amenities that Des Moines offers , \" Pins said . He pointed to the thousands of people in town for the recent state high school wrestling tournament , who drove on the city 's roads and visited amenities like the downtown sculpture park . Kim Rueben , a senior fellow in the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center , said voters might look at the local-option tax as a trade-off . It could mean paying more for certain items , but could lower property taxes and possibly keep rents from rising , she said . \" If it 's providing services that benefit lower-income people , then it might be a good trade-off , \" Rueben said . Where the money would go : Des Moines would spend half the money on property tax reduction , with the other half going to projects , including : Where the money would go : Alleman would use 50 percent of the revenue for tax relief and 50 percent for street repairs , debt payments , public safety and neighborhood improvements . Where the money would go : Altoona would use half of the funding for property tax relief and the other half for city projects , including streets , parks , sidewalks , water infrastructure , sanitary sewers , storm sewers and bridges , as well as public facilities , equipment purchases and economic development . Where the money would go : Pleasant Hill would use 85 percent of the revenue for property tax relief . The other 15 percent would go toward projects including public safety , parks , recreation and trails . Where the money would go : West Des Moines would use 50 percent of the revenue for property tax relief , lowering its property tax levy by 77 cents next fiscal year . The remaining 50 percent would be used to hire seven police officers and five firefighters and to fund transportation improvements , flood control projects , recreation projects and a refurbishment project at the public library . Where the money would go : Windsor Heights would use 50 percent of the revenue for property tax relief , lowering its property tax levy 69 cents . The remaining money would pay for street improvements , equipment costs , city building operations , insurance and emergency management . How Windsor Heights voted in 2018 : 51 percent yes To find your polling location , visit the Polk County Auditor 's website .

    "text": "Funchess never fulfilled his promise in four years with the Panthers Back in 2014 and 2015 , the Carolina Panthers selected monster-sized wide receivers Kelvin Benjamin and Devin Funchess in back-to-back drafts , reasoning that Cam Newton 's tendency to throw high and wide of his wide receivers meant he needed big-bodied targets with wide catch radii to cover for his relative inaccuracy . Benjamin was traded during the final year of his rookie contract in 2017 , with the Panthers receiving third and seventh-round picks in return . Now , they appear to be preparing to let Funchess walk after the expiration of his rookie deal . Funchess posted a video on Twitter Friday in which he referred to himself as a former Panther who is looking for a new team in free agency . Jourdan Rodrigue of the Charlotte Observer then reported that the Panthers have not even had talks with Funchess about a new deal . Funchess totaled 161 catches for 2,223 yards and 21 scores in his four years with Carolina , a stretch during which he was one of the least efficient receivers in football . Among the 223 players who were targeted at least 100 times during that four-season span , Funchess ' catch rate of 51.8 percent ranked 207th . His best season came in 2017 when he was Newton 's de facto No. 1 target , but he regressed in 2018 and is not necessarily a fit for the team 's new style of offense that emphasizes speed and the ability to make plays in open space , which is a better fit for players like Christian McCaffrey , D.J. Moore and Curtis Samuel . Funchess could find a home with a team looking for some size on the perimeter , but he seems mostly suited to being a red-zone weapon rather than a full-time No. 1 or No. 2 wideout ."

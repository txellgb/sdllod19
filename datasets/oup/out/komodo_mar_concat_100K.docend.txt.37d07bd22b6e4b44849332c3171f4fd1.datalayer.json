    "text": "For any Canadians suffering anxiety after reading Friday 's GDP figures , the release from Statistics Canada contained one possible remedy . For the first time , the statistics agency said , it was including the legal and illegal cannabis market in the national economic accounts . It had previously included only estimates related to the legal production , distribution and consumption of cannabis for medical purposes . Justin Trudeau 's administration legalised the recreational use of marijuana last year , enabling Canadians to buy the drug from regulated retailers and federally licensed producers . By Statistics Canada 's estimate , spending on cannabis hit an annual rate of C$ 5.9 bn ( $ 4.4 bn ) in the fourth quarter , equivalent to 0.5 per cent of all household spending . Non-medical cannabis now accounts for 11.2 per cent of all spending on alcohol , tobacco and cannabis . Legalisation only took effect in October , and illegal cannabis still accounted for the majority of all spending on the drug in the fourth quarter : $ 4.7 bn compared to $ 1.2 bn spent on legal highs ."

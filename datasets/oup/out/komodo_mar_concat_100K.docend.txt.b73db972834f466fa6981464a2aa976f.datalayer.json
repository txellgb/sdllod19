    "text": "So , bring -- coming back to you , Yamiche , listening to all this , did we learn anything new about legal implications for the president with regard to the Russia investigation ? Well , the key question coming out of this Michael Cohen hearing is going to be , is there any criminal and legal implications and consequences for anyone , either for President Trump or people around him , because of Michael Cohen 's testimony ? So I want to walk you through some legal problems that might pose to be an issue for the president . The first is Roger Stone and this WikiLeaks issue and these hack DNC e-mails . Right now , if the president was possibly directing Roger Stone to work with illegally -- illegally hacked information , that could prove to be a criminal problem for President Trump . The other thing is this Trump Tower Moscow project . Now , the president has said over and over again that he did n't have business going in with Russia during the campaign . But , in fact , this could be part of the -- what could be a case about collusion , because he would have had a business interest for working with Russia . The other thing I will talk about briefly is the Trump Tower meeting with Donald Trump Jr . Michael Cohen is making the case that President Trump knew very well that Donald Trump Jr. was walking into a meeting and trying to get information about Hillary Clinton from Russia . That also could be a problem , because that would be working with a foreign country to impact an American election . So we will have to see whether or not that happens . And there are , of course , political issues too , but these legal issues might be the ones that matter most ."

    "text": "Michael Reiners suggests that social media and the internet is is making us as execution-happy as Henry VIII when it comes to our friendships It goes without saying that relationships have been profoundly changed by the Internet . This is largely due to the ease with which images of other people can be summoned to the computer screen and become the objects of emotional attention . At the age of 23 , I have had the privilege of being raised one-foot in reality , the other in the fictional realm of social media . The monopoly on communication Facebook now holds had n't fully ' set-in ' during the years that shaped my pre-adolescent self . It had , however , arrived in time for my 15-year-old self to experience an unrequited message that had been seen & read at a precise time - it arrived in time for all the angst and sycophantic lust that 15-year-olds excel in . While it is true there is a living , breathing person at the other end of a jilted , hormonal adolescent 's Facebook message , the reaction itself is directed to an object of emotional attention on screen , not that human being . In human relations , risk-avoidance means the avoidance of accountability ; social media allows for this in spades . The refusal to stand judged in another 's eyes , to come face to face with another person , is the refusal to risk rejection . We all now use messaging services to communicate with friends and lovers . This sort of communication is not fundamentally different from that of letter writing , except for its speed , but speed is by no means a trivial feature . The rapidity of online communications does not merely accelerate the process whereby relationships are formed and severed ; it inevitably changes how those relationships are conducted and understood . ' Tag culture ' is one example of this . Facebook 's newsfeed today is no longer chronological , you may find it an effort to find content produced by another individual , one that you know . Instead , you may well maintain rapport with close friends by tagging them in humorous content that has been produced , targeted , and often monetised . The most transparent attempts at revenue-generating engagement of this kind are lists of common baby-names from the latter 1990s followed by the suggestion that \" people with these names , do X thing , tag them \" . \" Today , we remain fixed to our screens in times when we might otherwise be building relationships \" Of course , as consumers , we retain ultimate control over the internet : we can turn it off . Yet we do n't , and some people are frustrated , even anxious in its absence . One might say this is no different to the old clich\u00e9 of ' waiting by the telephone ' . That is , the kind of telephone which requires being plugged into a wall - the phone in Blondie 's 1980 hit ' Call Me ' was by no means a pocket-sized device designed to tether Debbie Harry to a carefully curated , online simulacra of herself that can be accessed both around the world and the clock . The careful creation of a virtual ambassador for yourself is a wholly recent invention , and even Madonna 's 2005 Hung Up predates this idea . Today , we remain fixed to our screens in times when we might otherwise be building relationships through conversation , activities , conflicts , and projects . More care than ever is given to curating an online gallery of our endeavours and social status . And navigating these social mores of social media causes people to appear to us merely as complex devices , to be negotiated for our own advantage and without opening the possibility of mutual judgement . Online friendships do not define your moral life : they are amusements , things that have no real life of their own , but borrow their life from your interest in them - what the Marxists would call \" fetishes . \" There is a strong argument to be made that the Facebook experience , which has attracted millions , is an antidote to shyness . It offers a way in which people otherwise cripplingly intimidated by venturing outwards into society can enjoy the web of affectionate relationships on which so much of our happiness depends . But there is an equally strong argument that the Facebook experience , to the extent that it is supplanting the physical realm of human relationships , intensifies shyness ; it substitutes a faux form of affection for the real human interactions that shy people can only get used to through exposure . Dating has become depersonalised too . Tinder , for one , has made romantic interactions into a ' human-supermarket ' of choice . We become consumers , spoiled for instantly gratifying choice . Placing a screen between yourself and another human , while still retaining ultimate control over what appears on that screen , allows you to hide from real encounters - denying the other the power and the freedom to challenge you in your deeper nature and to call on you here and now to take responsibility for yourself . The infamous unsolicited image of someone 's genitals was certainly not a regular occurrence via royal mail or fax . It could be said this is nothing new , Monarchs of old were presented with images of potential spouses , but as we become increasingly self-involved in our image , we emulate the monarchs of old . Henry VIII may well have felt a touch catfished after he effectively ' swiped right ' on Hans Holbein the Younger 's portrait of Anne of Cleeves ; yet , his more passionate relationship with Anne Boleyn ended in a hard block , of the chopping variety . This is the same mentality of human disposability that we employ online today , to the detriment of what it means to be social animals , to be human ."

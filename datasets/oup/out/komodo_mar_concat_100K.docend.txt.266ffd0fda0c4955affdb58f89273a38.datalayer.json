    "text": "A foreign company is ploughing ahead with plans to drill the Great Australian Bight , prompting public backlash amid fears of a \" catastrophic \" economic and environmental disaster . Norway oil giant Equinor has been lashed by fierce opposition after its own disaster-mitigation strategy showed oil could spread across the south coast of the Australian mainland and around Tasmania if the company 's plan goes awry . Protestors are gearing up for another \" Fight for the Bight \" this weekend when surfers will paddle out to sea for mass demonstrations across Victoria and South Australia . Equinor is confident the chances of a spill are extremely low , maintaining their exploratory drilling could uncover resources and eventually create more than 1000 jobs . Federal Resources Minister Matt Canavan has said offshore drilling was a \" national priority \" and exploring for oil in the Bight could help the country 's fuel security . But critics - including independently funded think-tank The Australia Institute - said resources found in a successful operation would go offshore and there was little in the plan of benefit to the local economy . They said it 's not worth the risk to pristine beaches , rare marine life , fishing industries and tourism , nor the climate impact of expanding a fossil fuel industry . Mr Canavan was unavailable for interview for three days this week , and his office did not answer The New Daily 's questions about jobs or whether the government could guarantee any resources would remain in Australia . Further emails and calls to his spokeswoman went unanswered . South Australian projects manager for The Australia Institute Noah Schultz-Byard said Equinor 's project could put more than 9000 jobs on the line by risking the environment upon which they rely . \" South Australians are being asked to carry all the risks while a foreign oil company comes to take all of the financial gain , \" Mr Schultz-Byard told The New Daily . \" As our submission to the Senate inquiry into drilling in the Bight found , the economic benefits are minimal . \" Equinor 's draft environment report shows that in the event of a blowout , if workers could not stop oil flowing from their exploration well 2000m deep in the ocean it would take 15 days to bring an emergency cap - a giant piece of equipment - from Singapore . That could blow out to 102 days if a second cap was needed . Latest worst-case-scenario mapping reveals that even if the company mitigated the impact of a spill , oil could still reach beaches as far as Albany in Western Australia and up the east coast to Sydney . Sludge would cover the shores of King Island and most of Tasmania . Equinor said it had planned \" meticulously \" , and that out of 59,000 offshore wells drilled worldwide since 1980 there had been just two disasters . One of those was BP 's 2010 Gulf of Mexico spill which killed 11 people and affected 180,000 square kilometres of ocean . The Bight is of enormous significance to biodiversity , home to species found nowhere else on earth , and a key breeding ground for mammals including sea lions and the southern right whales which also attract tourists . The CSIRO and other researchers , backed by BP , released a report on its four-year-long research into the Bight last year . Scientists involved in the project announced in November they had discovered 400 new species in the area . Protest organiser in Port Fairy , in southwest Victoria , Ben Druitt said : \" The Great Australian Bight is a unique , pristine wilderness marine environment , with 85 per cent of its marine species found only in these waters . \" Wilderness Society South Australia Director Peter Owen said Equinor was acting worse than BP , which has been among other companies to pull out of plans to drill the \" magnificent \" Bight . \" We 're being asked to carry an enormous risk , \" Mr Owen told The New Daily . \" If things go well , they go away with the profits - if things go badly , we could be essentially wiped off the map . \" Equinor is an energy giant majority-owned by Norway . Since 2011 , the Australian government has awarded 11 exploration permits in the Bight . If it gets regulatory approval , Equinor plans to begin its Stromlo-1 drilling at one site 370km from South Australian coast in late 2020 . Equinor said that - should they find oil or gas - jobs and an economic boost were part of the \" potential benefits \" . A 2018 report compiled for the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association found resource discovery could support 1500 jobs in South Australia over 40 years , and another 3400 nationwide . Supporters also point to the project as a way to help sure-up Australia 's fuel security at a time when the country is so dependent on importing almost all of its oil . Research by The Australia Institute , however , showed the economic benefit and impact on the labour market would be minimal while the project carried great risk to tourism , aquaculture and wild fisheries . And there has been no guarantee about whether resources would stay in Australia - or how oil would be refined . Equinor has opened its draft environment plan . The public has until March 20 to comment to the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority ( NOPSEMA ) . Meanwhile , the Greens are pushing for World Heritage Protection for the Bight ."

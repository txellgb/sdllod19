    "text": "MUMBAI * India 's economy slowed considerably last quarter , with little sign of a quick recovery amid rising political tensions with Pakistan and weaker global demand . Gross domestic product ( GDP ) rose 6.6 per cent in the three months to December from a year ago , lower than the 6.7 per cent median estimate in a Bloomberg survey and down from a revised 7 per cent in the previous quarter . Simmering tensions between the nuclear-armed rivals India and Pakistan have the potential to hurt foreign investments and sour business sentiment in India 's economy - one of the fastest-growing in the world - as it also faces weaker domestic demand and a global slowdown . That may give the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) , under new governor Shaktikanta Das , reason to cut interest rates again after last month 's surprise easing . A 19-month low in inflation , coupled with weaker growth , \" creates space for further cuts \" , economists at Citigroup , led by Mr Samiran Chakraborty , said in a note . Relations with Pakistan soured this week after India accused its neighbour of being responsible for a major terrorist attack in Kashmir , which was followed by tit-for-tat airstrikes between both countries . \" This comes at a tricky time for both sides , as India heads into the general elections in April-May 2019 , while Pakistan is in a tenuous economic position , \" said Ms Radhika Rao , an economist at DBS Group in Singapore . Waning consumer demand has dampened momentum in India 's economy , where domestic spending makes up about two-thirds of GDP . The government sees no cause for concern in the GDP estimate , Economic Affairs Secretary Subhash Chandra Garg said yesterday . For the past two quarters , domestic passenger vehicle sales growth - a gauge of urban demand - eased . Cement production , a measure of construction activity , abated slightly . As the government cuts back on capital expenditure in its latest budget to curb the fiscal deficit , economists see more sluggishness . \" The slackness in government capital expenditure ahead of elections tends to have a lagged impact , affecting growth in the following quarters , \" said Ms Teresa John , economist at Nirmal Bang Equities India . A benign inflation environment gives policymakers room to cut interest rates again . Consumer price inflation is close to two per cent ; core inflation , which strips out volatile food and fuel costs , has begun to ease . The measures are expected to converge in the coming months as the economy shows more signs of a slowdown . \" We continue to believe that fundamentals do not support any meaningful increase in inflation , \" said Bank of America Merrill Lynch chief economist Indranil Sen Gupta . Cost-push inflation is contained by falling commodity prices . \""

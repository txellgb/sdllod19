    "text": "It 's Women 's History Month ! You 're reading In Her Words , where women rule the headlines . \" History is n't what happened . It 's who tells the story . \" -- Sally Roesch Wagner , a women 's studies scholar and author In her new book , \" The Women 's Suffrage Movement , \" the historian Sally Roesch Wagner aims to finally give a voice to the women history forgot . \" History is n't what happened , \" she told me this week . \" It 's who tells the story . \" Dr. Wagner , one of the first Americans to receive a doctorate in women 's studies , has spent decades studying these untold stories across cultures . On the first day of Women 's History Month , I asked her to help me debunk some of the persistent myths . MYTH : American women 's rights began with the right to vote , granted in 1920 . REALITY : Native American women have had political power for 1,000 years . It 's easy to view American women 's history through the lens of the suffragists , who fought for the right to vote . But the truth is , Native American women had their own political systems long before -- systems that still exist . \" The idea that we 're so progressive because we got the vote 100 years ago -- Native women look at that like , ' Hm , well , ' \" said Wagner , who wrote the book \" Sisters in Spirit , \" about Iroquois women 's influence on early American feminists . In fact , in some Native American nations , like the six Iroquois , the elder matriarch is responsible for appointing the chief , holding him to certain standards and removing him if he fails to measure up , Wagner said . MYTH : Contraception is a modern convention . REALITY : Condoms , diaphragms and the sponge have been around since the 1800s . The birth control pill may have not come on the market until 1960 , but a variety of effective contraception methods were available to both women and men in the United States well before 1850 , Wagner said . It was the Comstock Act , passed in 1873 , that changed everything -- allowing Anthony Comstock , a conservative Christian who proposed the legislation , to determine what was considered \" obscene \" in the country . \" He decided that anything to do with sex or reproduction was obscene , \" Wagner said . As a result , hundreds of people were arrested and imprisoned under the Comstock Act for distributing or possessing contraception , or publishing information about it . The activist Ida Craddock was among them , arrested for distributing such information . She took her own life shortly before her sentencing , which she believed would be life imprisonment . In her suicide note , she wrote : \" I earnestly hope that the American public will awaken to a sense of the danger which threatens it from Comstockism . \" MYTH : Feminists burned bras . REALITY : No bras were burned ! The myth emerged on a hot summer day in 1969 , when feminists gathered on the boardwalk of the Miss America Pageant in Atlantic City , N.J. , to protest the competition . They had planned to burn their bras , but they could n't get the permits -- so instead they threw their bras , girdles , curling irons and other \" instruments of female torture , \" into a giant trash can labeled \" freedom . \" ( Read more about that protest here . ) The New York Post ran with the story anyway -- and the myth has been used to vilify and pigeonhole feminists ever since , Wagner said . Want to hear more from Dr. Wagner ? She 'll be in conversation with Gloria Steinem , the Mohawk Bear clan mother Louise Herne and the New York Times gender editor Jessica Bennett in New York on International Women 's Day , March 8 . Tickets are still available . 0.5 percent That 's how much of 3,500 years of recorded history is devoted to women , according to the historian and author Bettany Hughes . \" There are so many women that should be household names but just are n't , \" she has said . The stories of seven black inventors who helped shape American life , including Dr. Patricia Bath , above , and Marie Van Brittan Brown , who patented a home security system . \" This feels like one generation locking down the church for the next . \" The United Methodist Church tightens its ban on same-sex marriage and gay clergy . Two African-American women are headed for a runoff in the Chicago mayor 's race , setting up an election that will make history . \" I did n't kill my baby . \" \" The trauma of seeing my son die was so great that I had to give up obstetrics , \" writes Dr. Jen Gunter . \" I was ashamed and I was doing the best I could and I was a great mother , but it was killing me . \" The actress Selma Blair shares her multiple sclerosis story , and many hear their own . Pop-up Herstory : Emma Gatewood , the first woman to conquer the Appalachian Trail alone For women 's history month , we 're highlighting stories of trailblazing women you may not know , but should . For daily posts , see our Instagram . Known by some newspapers as \" America 's most celebrated pedestrian , \" Emma Gatewood was the first woman to hike the Appalachian Trail by herself in one season -- as a great-grandmother , at the age of 67 . By the time Gatewood died at the age of 85 , in 1973 , she had hiked the length of the trail three times -- the third time in sections -- and was the first person , man or woman , to conquer it more than once . What the public did not know was equally remarkable . Read past articles here ."

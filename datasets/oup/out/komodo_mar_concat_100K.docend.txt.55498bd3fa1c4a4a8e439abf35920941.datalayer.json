    "text": "People and industries spread across 20 counties in southwest Georgia are still looking for aid in recovering from Hurricane Michael . And the challenges for families trying to get back on their feet has prompted a first ever use of a welfare benefit as disaster aid . At the level of the overall economy of the region , Senators from the southeastern United States are asking Congress for billions of dollars in extra disaster relief . A bill introduced by Georgia Senator David Perdue would provide money for repairing infrastructure , restoring coastlines and helping farmers who lost crops not just in Georgia but across the Southeast as well as in Puerto Rico and the island of Mauritius . Senator Johnny Isakson is one of the bill 's co-sponsors . He said an area of special concern the bill would address in Georgia is the state 's pecan industry . \" 75 percent of it was wiped out . And you know how long it takes to replace a pecan orchard ? Fifteen to twenty years , \" Isakson said from the floor of the Senate while asking for a speedy passage of the disaster relief bill . Hurricane Michael caused an estimated $ 2.5 billion dollars in losses to Georgia agriculture . Meanwhile , the storm pushed many people into poverty who had been living just on the cusp of qualifying for temporary assistance for needy families , or TANF , benefits . So , The Georgia Division of Family and Children Services is issuing around $ 15 million in special disaster TANF benefits to families trying repair homes or make down payments on new apartment leases . Deputy Director Jon Anderson says this is the first time any state has used this welfare benefit as disaster aid . \" We really feel like what happened with Hurricane Michael is unprecedented and really we need to get this program out , \" Anderson said . The benefits will be limited to families which have already been working with FEMA in recovering from the storm . But , the income ceiling tips well into the middle class . For instance , a family of four with gross income of $ 75,000 might still qualify according to the rules established by Georgia DFCS . The federal block grant the money comes from still has to cover conventional assistance to needy families . The estimated 33,000 families affected have from March 4 to the March 15 to mail in a paper application ."

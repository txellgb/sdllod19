    "text": "2018 was another historic year in Paris property sales - great news for sellers , financially crippling news for buyers . This was according to results unveiled in the Chamber of Notaries of Greater Paris on Thursday . Purchase price per square metre continued to rise to record heights and the sales volume continues to grow ( though it did dip slightly from 2017 peaks ) . There are obviously huge differences between prices for Paris and its suburbs . The average price per metre in the \u00cele-de-France region is 5,970 euros ( 4.5 percent more than in 2017 ) . But you need an average of 9,750 euros if you dream of living in the heart of Paris , up 5.7 percent in one year . The cheapest area to buy in the city centre is La Chapelle in the 18th arrondissement at 7,460 euros per square metre , which is still an increase of 11.3 percent since last year . If you 're feeling a little flush , the most expensive area in Paris now is Odeon in the 6th at an incredible 17,410 euros per metre , a whopping rise of 28.3 percent in just one year . One of the key causes of this continuing rise is the shortage of new houses being built . Notaries now estimate that the symbolic bar of 10,000 euros per metre squared on average in Paris ( long presented as an impassable \" glass ceiling \" ) will probably be reached as early as this summer ."

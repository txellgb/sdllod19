    "text": "The first two months of the year are very much the time when the wine trade sets its stall out for the year . Most of the major UK agents and distributors host major tastings of their portfolios , with new vintages , new wines and , as seems the norm these days , new prices . Recently I found myself recently on the banks of the Thames on a beautiful spring day at a tasting hosted by Gonsalez Byass UK . With more than 100 wines to taste it 's always difficult to narrow down so here are a few stars from the day . Rathfinny Wine Estate was established in 2010 near Alfriston on the South Downs , with the aim of being one of the most significant single vineyards in England and it has certainly been the subject of a great deal of interest within the UK wine trade ever since . They released their first sparkling wines last year and this was the first opportunity I had had to taste them . Rathfinny Estate Ros\u00e9 2016 , Sussex ( rathinnyestate.com for more info and oxfordwine.com \u00a3 35.95 ) is a Pinot Noir dominated blend which has spent 24 months ageing on its lees and without question is a welcome addition to the growing number of world-class English sparkling ros\u00e9s . It 's a very pretty pale pink in the glass , there are delicate red fruits and citrus notes on the nose , followed by soft red fruits and crisp acidity on the plate before a nice long , focussed finish . This is the second release of this wine and you may find that the 2015 is the wine currently available , but regardless this is very fine sparkling wine indeed . Hopping over the channel , Champagne Duetz launched two new single vineyard wines which were brilliant , but of course with a price to match . Deutz Brut Classic NV ( Ocado \u00a3 42.50 ) is a lovely introduction to this much admired house . A blend of all three classic Champagne grapes , this is aged for three years before release and is really all about elegance and purity . There are notes of white flowers , pears , almonds and a touch of brioche on the nose , followed by a medium bodied palate with a long , very focused finish . This is very fine Champagne . The story of Domaine Jones from the Languedoc in the south of France is almost worth a novel in itself.The estate was established by Katie Jones , an Englishwoman who left for the good life in the south of France . She established her own vineyards in 2008 and her wines are now recognised as some of the most interesting in the region . Domaine Jones Fitou 2012 ( Fareham Wine Cellar \u00a3 15.25 ) is made from a blend of carignan , grenache and syrah from old vines , most of which are more than 100 years old . It shows plenty of deep , dark fruits , liquorice , spice and a touch of dried herbs , which is followed by a long , concentrated palate with enough grip to keep it honest . This is such a lovely wine , try this with confit duck or a ribeye steak cooked over charcoal ."

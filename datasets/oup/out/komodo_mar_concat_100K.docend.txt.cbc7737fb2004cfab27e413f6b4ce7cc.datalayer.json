    "text": "Celebrate Women 's History Month with Queer Women Who Paved the Way The roots of Women 's History Month began in 1981 when Congress authorized a Women 's History Week to begin on March 7 , 1982 . For the next five years , Congress authorized a week in March to be set aside as Women 's History Week . Finally , the Women 's History Project got involved and petitioned lawmakers makers to name an entire month to honor the achievements of women . March 1987 became the first Women 's History Month . To kick off Women 's History Month , we celebrate the accomplishments of queer women who moved the needle forward for generations to come through their activism , grit , and in many cases by just being unapologetically themselves in the face of sexism and anti-LGBTQ oppression . These 20 people including Lorraine Hansberry , Lorena Hickok , and Dorothy Arzner all helped push toward wider acceptance of LGBTQ people through their contributions to their fields of expertise and through their legacies ."

    "text": "I bet you 've forgotten all about that movie , have n't you ? While it 's quietly been pushed down the conveyer belt by Warner Bros. over the past several years , it looks like they still intend on making it . Previous reports have had Spider-Man : Homecoming writers John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein on board to helm the eventual Ezra Miller-starring vehicle , but according to a new report from Deadline , they may be doing a bit more . The outlet buried this information in a report chronicling the departure of Michael Disco from New Line Cinema and Warner Bros . While he is leaving to start his own production company , he is still on board to produce The Flash -- and the duo pegged to helm the film are also supposedly serving as screenwriters on the movie . This is n't the biggest surprise in the world . Often when a director comes into a big film , they work hard with a screenwriter to cater the script to their own sensibilities . Given that Daley and Goldstein have a history of screenwriting , it would make sense they 'd take the script and make it their own themselves . Why hand it off to someone else when you can do it yourself , right ? To me , this is great news , as the pair did a great job with Spider-Man : Homecoming , a film that did n't need to be anywhere near as good as it ended up being . Getting them to bring on that fun spirit into the world of The Flash can only be a good thing . What do you think of this revelation ?"

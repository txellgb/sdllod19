    "text": "Anfield legend understands Kepa refusing to go off - as he recalls his own frustration after 2001 Community Shield win JAMIE CARRAGHER has slammed Kepa 's critics - after admitting he had a huge Wembley tantrum himself for Liverpool . Anfield legend Carragher told how he threw his 2001 Charity Shield winners ' medal into the crowd as he had only came on as a late sub in the 2-1 victory over Manchester United . And the Sky TV pundit says Kepa was just showing the same burning frustration when he refused to be taken off for Chelsea in last Sunday 's Carabao Cup final before Manchester City won the penalty shootout . Former England defender Carragher eventually \" regretted \" his own similar outburst of emotion 18 years ago - and got the medal back after sending out an appeal . The 41-year-old wrote in his Telegraph column that fury aimed at Kepa by ex-players was \" hypocritical \" and over the top - although he did \" not condone \" the keeper 's actions . Carragher , who played more than 500 games for Liverpool , said : \" I certainly do not believe he deserves the level of condemnation he has received . . \" To substitute a goalkeeper in those situations is the ultimate humiliation . \" He added : \" In 2001 , I was so upset at being left out of the Charity Shield , when I was handed the winners ' medal I threw it into the crowd . \" Liverpool 's manager at the time , Gerard Houllier , only read about it in the newspaper . \" My feeling was I had made no contribution to the result so did n't want a medal . \" I am sure Arrizabalaga felt differently , like I did , away from the emotion of a match day . \" Carragher claimed top players are taught \" never to accept second best personally as well as collectively \" so Kepa would feel \" confused and livid \" . Spaniard Kepa later apologised and was fined a week 's wages , as well as being dropped to the bench for Wednesday 's 2-0 Premier League defeat of Spurs . But he is widely expected to win a recall for sixth-placed Chelsea at second-bottom Fulham on Sunday ."

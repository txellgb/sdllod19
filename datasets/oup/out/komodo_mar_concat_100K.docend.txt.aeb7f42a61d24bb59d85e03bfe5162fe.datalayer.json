    "text": "The Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau is expected to announce February 's gross gaming revenue today , or by Sunday at the latest . The results will afford analysts a more rounded view of how 2019 is responding to several macro-economic factors , including the China-U.S. trade war , diminishing purchasing power of mainland customers and new policies designed by Beijing to curb money laundering and capital outflows . Gross gaming revenue in the Macau SAR wobbled last month to post the first monthly fall in two years and the first year-on-year decline since the gaming slump ended in 2016 . Full-month revenue amounted to about MOP24 .9 billion , in line with the average monthly take in 2018 . According to some analysts , the posting indicates a period of market consolidation and the entry into what has been described by government officials as the \" new normal \" of Macau gaming . It may also represent a stress test for Macau as the city 's highly-exposed economy braces for spillover from the ongoing China-U.S. trade war . Early analyst predictions for February suggested little in the way of year-on-year growth . However , according to industry insiders , Macau gross gaming revenue posted strong results in the week following the Chinese Lunar New Year , showing a 32 percent year-on-year rise led by VIP activity . That followed a record-breaking number of tourists in the week before , rising more than 26 percent to 1.2 million . The mass segment also performed well , with average daily mass revenue per day tracking 5 percent higher during that week than the January 2019 average . Due to the variable timing of the Chinese Lunar New Year , which falls either in January or February , the first two months of the year are sometimes considered in tandem ."

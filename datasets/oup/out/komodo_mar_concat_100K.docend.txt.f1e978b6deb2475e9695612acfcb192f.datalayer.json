Achieving the Dream leads a national network of more than 220 community colleges championing evidence-based improvements to help community-college students achieve their goals , resulting in improved skills , better employability , and economic growth for families , communities , and the nation as a whole . Participating colleges focus on seven essential areas : leadership and vision ; data and technology ; equity ; teaching and learning ; engagement and communication ; strategy and planning ; and policies and practices . \" The college as a whole has embraced ATD 's principles . Subcommittees of faculty , staff , and students have been gathering and analyzing data to develop new strategies aimed at strengthening and promoting more equitable outcomes , \" noted Kingsborough Community College President Claudia Schrader . Kingsborough has focused on overcoming opportunity gaps by identifying barriers that are nearly always outside the student 's control , including race , English proficiency , and family or community wealth . \" The metrics ATD established for Leader College of Distinction are meant to encourage colleges to sustain aggressive efforts that result in far greater student success and equity , \" said Dr. Karen A. Stout , president and chief executive officer of Achieving the Dream . Only colleges that have been Leader Colleges for three or more years were invited to apply ."

    "text": "EDINBURGH 'S future public service provision could be determined by artificial intelligence - after University researchers were handed \u00a3 60m in funding to explore how data could shape the future of the Capital . The Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal Joint Committee is expected to approve a final business case for the Edinburgh Futures Institute ( EFI ) at a meeting today , which will see more than 350 organisations work together to plan for the ' city of tomorrow ' . It means everything from the number of homes and schools to be built to the expansion of the Capital 's public transport network could soon be influenced by AI . EFI , based at the former Edinburgh Royal Infirmary , is one of five Data-Driven Innovation ( DDI ) hubs to receive funding as part of the \u00a3 1.3 bn city region deal - an agreement between the UK and Scottish governments and local authorities across the Lothians to invest in the area 's future . It aims to transform the city into the ' data capital of Europe , ' while also committing to providing infrastructure and public services for the future . Leeann Dempster , chair of the Edinburgh and South East Scotland city region deal regional enterprise council , said : \" The challenge is to harness the revolution in data , digital and artificial intelligence in ways that benefits people across our region . \" She added : \" The opportunity could n't be greater . Data-driven innovation can be at the heart of improved public services for everyone and giving people access to new skills , opportunities and careers . \" The deal also plans to invest around \u00a3 65m for new housing , \u00a3 120m for a flyover at the Sheriffhall roundabout , \u00a3 20m for roads in West Edinburgh and \u00a3 20m for a new 1000-seater concert hall off St Andrew Square . Infrastructure Secretary , Michael Matheson said : \" I am delighted to see the Data Driven Innovation programme take another step forward with the approval of the Edinburgh Futures Institute business case . \" \" Using \u00a3 300 million of Scottish Government investment , the Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal is designed to deliver inclusive economic growth , providing opportunities and distributing the benefits fairly across the entire region . \" EFI 's Director , Professor Lesley McAra , said that fast moving developments in data , digital and artificial intelligence create both opportunities and challenges for society . Universities therefore have a duty to place their research and teaching in the service of communities , industry and government . Professor McAra continued : \" We aim to ensure that data-driven innovation is carried out with deep regard for its ethical implications and corresponding impact on individuals , communities , and society as a whole . \""

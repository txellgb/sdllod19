    "text": "There is an opportunity to give some local politicians an earful . Just in case they 've forgotten the root word in representative is represent , six of them will be holding a town hall in Twin Falls . Along with the State Representatives we also expect two State Senators in attendance Saturday morning . The event is sponsored by the Twin Falls County Republican Party . It begins at 10 o'clock Saturday . The location is the Planning and Zoning Office at County West ( the old hospital ) . The office is on the ground floor , has plenty of seats and faces Addison Avenue . There is a large pro-life contingent expected to attend . They 're wondering why there has n't been any action in Boise on a proposed bill to ban abortion in Idaho . Several other Republican dominated states are following the call of the unborn . It 's time public employees holding public office put what they say into practice . The event is only scheduled for two hours . I 'm not sure if the legislators plan a lengthy filibuster in advance of questions but a show of support could be an eye opener ."

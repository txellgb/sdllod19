    "text": "Vice President Mike Pence speaks during CPAC 2019 . Vice President Mike Pence appeared at the Conservative Political Action Conference ( CPAC ) on Friday to frame the 2020 presidential election as a referendum on socialist policies . \" Bernie 's been joined by a chorus of newly elected officials , \" Pence told the crowd . \" But what they 're actually offering is just more of the same : more taxes , more spending , more government and less freedom . \" \" It was freedom , not socialism , that gave us the most prosperous economy in the world , \" continued the vice president . Pence accused Democratic Socialists of wanting to make \" poverty more comfortable \" for Americans . We want to make poverty more rare ; they want to make poverty more comfortable , \" said Pence . Most CPAC speakers this year have sounded the alarm on socialism 's rise in the Democratic Party , taking special aim at Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez 's ' Green New Deal ' package . Pence was no exception , saying \" the only thing green about the green new deal is how much ' green ' the deal is going to cost taxpayers . \""

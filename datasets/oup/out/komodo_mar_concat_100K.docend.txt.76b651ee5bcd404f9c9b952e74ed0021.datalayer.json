    "text": "America First Action is central to the president 's billion-dollar campaign plans , but the super PAC is struggling to find someone to take the reins . President Donald Trump wants to raise $ 1 billion for his reelection . But his top advisers worry that the super PAC at the center of that effort is hurting , lacking a high-wattage leader who can cajole millionaire and billionaire donors to fork over huge sums . Trump political aides , members of the president 's family , and top Republicans have been considering potential candidates to spearhead America First Action 's 2020 fundraising efforts . They want someone with deep ties to the president and the clubby world of major GOP donors . But the nationwide search has so far come up empty . Super PAC organizers at one point came up with a roster of around two-dozen names that included Robert Kraft , who was never seriously considered but was quashed anyway after the New England Patriots owner -- a fixture at the president 's Mar-a-Lago resort -- was charged with soliciting prostitution . Another person floated for the post was GOP benefactor Kelly Craft , but she was ruled out after being nominated for United Nations ambassador . Then there 's Nick Ayers . A former White House official who is close to many top Republican givers , he had been widely expected to take a senior advisory role with the super PAC after departing the administration late last year . But the 36-year-old Ayers , who 's spent the last few months with his family and quail hunting in Georgia , has yet to sign on . Many of those seen as good fits for the post are tied up in administration jobs . Woody Johnson , a former New York Jets owner and Jeb Bush 2016 finance chair , is serving as ambassador to the United Kingdom . Senior White House advisers Kellyanne Conway and Johnny DeStefano have been mentioned , though there 's widespread doubt either will end up at the group . The extensive search has reinforced rising concerns about America First Action . In interviews , nearly a dozen people close to the president described it as the soft underbelly of a three-tiered , rapidly expanding Trump reelection apparatus . While the campaign has hired over 30 staffers and the Republican National Committee has begun building out an ambitious get-out-the-vote program , many are convinced the two-year-old America First Action has never gotten the attention it needs -- and not ready for the heat of a presidential reelection campaign . The super PAC and its allied nonprofit arm , America First Policies , raised over $ 75 million during the 2018 midterms -- a respectable figure , but short of the $ 100 million goal it had set for itself . Trump aides say they 're counting on the group to raise between $ 300 million and $ 400 million for the 2020 campaign . But that will require a high-profile emissary to conservative givers . \" A super PAC is complementary to the party and the campaign , so it 's a three-legged stool . And you ca n't sit on a stool unless you have three legs , \" said Bradley Blakeman , who founded Freedom 's Watch , a conservative group that was active during the final years of the George W. Bush White House . \" You need the ability to raise money from whatever buckets you can raise from with the intent to elect Republicans in 2020 - especially the president . The pressure is great . And it 's not a thing you want to have done , it 's a thing you need to have done . \" Republican officials are scrambling to fill the vacancy that was created when businessman and Trump family friend Tommy Hicks Jr. left the America First Action chairmanship to take a leadership position at the RNC . The void comes as Democratic billionaires eager to defeat Trump are set to pour millions of dollars into liberal-aligned super PACs . Roy Bailey , a top fundraising official for America First Action , said the group is \" in a time of transition . \" \" I think we will end up strengthening our organization internally over the next several months , \" he added . The search has taken on increased urgency in recent weeks with the uncertainty surrounding Ayers , who 'd been regarded as the leading candidate for the role . Ayers , the former chief of staff to Mike Pence chief of staff , is close to many of the party 's top givers . He has sought clarity on how his communications with Pence and other administration officials would be restricted , if at all , if he took a role with the super PAC . Federal laws restrict the ability of outside groups and party officials to coordinate their activities . Ayers , along with Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale and America First Action President Brian O. Walsh , met recently with attorneys at the Jones Day law firm in Washington . The group discussed legal matters surrounding the super PAC , including rules governing communication , according to several people familiar with the discussion . \" I would love for Nick to do it . He could be great if he did , but he 's told people he wants to think about it for a while , \" said Doug Deason , an America First Action finance committee member who 's been in touch with Ayers . Deason and Bailey met over lunch on Tuesday to discuss who might lead the group . But the two struggled to come up with a name . \" They 're not technically equipped [ for 2020 ] until they get a chairman in place . It 's not going to be as effective as it has been until they get a chair , \" Deason said . \" Once they do that , they 'll be back in the groove . It just helps to have that key person in charge . \" However , \" It does n't seem like they have any hot prospects right now , \" he added . For now , the group is leaning heavily on Walsh , a 42-year-old Republican strategist who as president oversees the super PAC 's day-to-day operations . Walsh , who 's worked for an array of conservative candidates and outside groups and has earned praise from top Trump campaign officials , declined to say who might take the chairmanship spot . \" America First Action did n't exist in 2016 . Yet , in less than two years , we 've raised tens of millions , had a winning record in the midterms , and firmly established ourselves as the primary super PAC in support of President Trump 's re-election , \" Walsh said in a statement . \" We 're making some adjustments , but greatly appreciate the support we 've received and look forward to building on the success of the last cycle to help re-elect President Donald J. Trump in 2020 . \" Republican officials are anxious for the super PAC to replicate the success of Priorities USA . During Barack Obama 's successful 2012 reelection campaign , the liberal super PAC invested tens of millions of dollars on TV ads assailing Republican nominee Mitt Romney over his career as a venture capitalist . The hope , senior party officials say , is that America First Action will stockpile cash over the next year in anticipation of launching an all-out blitz against the eventual Democratic nominee . Yet America First Action has confronted an array of complications . After former Trump chief strategist Steve Bannon departed the White House in 2017 , word spread that he wanted to start an outside group of his own . That sparked confusion among donors who wondered whether America First Action or Bannon 's planned outfit was the main pro-Trump group . There has also been a multitude of senior-level departures . Ayers had been helping to spearhead the group but left in 2017 to become Pence 's chief of staff . Parscale left the super PAC last year to become the Trump 's campaign manager . And Rick Gates , a Trump 2016 campaign aide who later became embroiled in the special counsel probe , departed America First Action early on after helping to found the group . Walsh was tapped in April 2017 to bring a measure of stability to the super PAC . By the end of the 2018 campaign , America First Action had managed to organize carefully tailored events with Trump , Pence , and several cabinet members . And some moves are afoot for 2020 : Walsh recently reached out to the White House in hopes of organizing a future event with the president , and Trump 's son , Donald Trump Jr. , is slated to appear at a March 12 fundraiser for the super PAC in New York City . There 's talk among senior Republicans about the possibility of other pro-Trump outfits emerging if America First Action 's leadership situation is n't settled soon . That could scramble the constellation of conservative outside groups , and raise questions about which pro-Trump organization major donors should give to . \" A strong super PAC can make a tremendous difference , \" said Rick Reed , a Trump 2016 adviser who helped to spearhead the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth attacks on John Kerry in 2004 . \" I 'd hope there might be more than one . \""

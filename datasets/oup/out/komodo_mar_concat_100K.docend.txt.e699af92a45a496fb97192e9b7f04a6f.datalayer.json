    "text": "Healesville Environment Watch Inc. ( HEWI ) urges residents to dispose of their green waste in a responsible manner . This comes after the environmental volunteer group found large piles of green waste dumped by the Wallace Parade Bridge in Healesville . The waste included branches , palm fronds and Agapanthus as well as an abandoned tyre . HEWI states that large amounts of green waste dumped in waterways can rot in the water and decrease the oxygen available to native plant and animal life , while seeds can be carried downstream to germinate . HEWI believe the green waste has been dumped on location on more than one occasion throughout January and February . HEWI and Mt Toolebewong and District Landcare Group Waterwatch volunteers found the green waste when conducting their monthly water sampling . HEWI will be holding a Clean Up Australia Day session at Queens Park , Healesville on Friday 8 March from 9 - 11.30 am . Community members are welcome to assist , and bags , gloves and Morning Tea will be provided . For more information please contact : 5962 1224 ."

    "text": "The ever-excellent MacRumors has attained a new research note from financial giant Barclays which reveals iPhones will not only miss out on 5G in 2019 , but all 2020 models may be restricted to 4G as well . Barclays explains that the modem design for 2020 iPhones \" needs to be set now , \" and Intel 's race to ship its first 5G smartphone modem in late 2019 \" does not work with Apple 's timeline . \" Compounding this is Apple 's legal fight with Qualcomm . The chip giant is the obvious alternative and its 5G modems are commercially ready . Unfortunately , the two companies are engaged in a ferocious legal battle and Barclays states that time \" seems to be running out \" for Apple to patch up differences with Qualcomm to plug its Intel-shaped gap . It also seems Apple has exhausted all alternative avenues . Apple testified that it approached Samsung and MediaTek as potential suppliers , but doubts have emerged that they can \" meet Apple 's production , performance , and cost demands . \" Apple has even started working on its own modems , but they are years away from commercial release . The good news is Apple should get away with it this year . While 5G phones and 5G networks will both launch this year , availability will be limited . But this changes in 2020 and releasing premium iPhones without 5G for the October 2020 to October 2021 lifecycle is marketing suicide . When Apple and Qualcomm kicked off their legal battle in 2017 , it was widely assumed Apple had the upper hand . But it appears the technological tide is turning quickly . Recent Qualcomm victories infuriated Apple and today 's news will do nothing to improve the company 's mood ... Apple Patents New iPhone Laser Display Upgrade"

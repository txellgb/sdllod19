    "text": "Nanoparticles influence their liquid environment ( Nanowerk News ) These days , nanoparticles finely distributed in suspensions are used in many areas - for example in cosmetic products , in industrial catalysts , or in contrast agents for medicinal examinations . For the first time , a research team from the University of Bayreuth has managed to precisely determine the interrelationships of magnetic nanoparticles with the liquid surrounding them , even down to the atomic level . As it turns out , it is mainly a question of the crystalline structure of the nano-particle as to how water molecules in their immediate vicinity re-align themselves ."

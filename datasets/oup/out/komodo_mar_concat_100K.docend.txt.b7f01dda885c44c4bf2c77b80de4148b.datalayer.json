    "text": "By MUTHONI WAWERU , NAIROBI , Kenya , Mar 1 - Some 10,000 pupils are set to benefit from free dental screening and treatment , courtesy of Oral Health Program rolled out by Mars Wrigley Confectionery and the Kenya Dental Association ( KDA ) . The program , which is funded to the tune of Sh13 .7 million by Mars Wrigley Confectionery 's Oral Health Community Service Grant , will cover Kajiado , Machakos and Meru counties . This marks the second phase of the program , following the successful completion of the first phase last year . \" In several regions , poor oral hygiene remains one of the leading causes of school absenteeism , with children who experience dental pain missing school and performing poorly academically , \" Andrew Wetende , Chairman KDA said , \" Yet , simple and cost-effective preventive oral health strategies are crucial for avoiding costly cures . \" The first phase , which was inaugurated by Nairobi Senator , Johnson Sakaja , reached about 10,000 children in Nairobi , Murang ' a and Nakuru counties . This means that on completion of phase two , which has just kicked off in Kajiado county , a total of 20,000 children across six counties will have benefited in two years . \" Due to the unequal distribution of oral health personnel and the lack of appropriate and functional facilities within the primary health care system across the country , many people have limited or no access to appropriate oral health care services and thus there is need for continuous awareness creation on effective dental self-care , \" Wetende explained . \" For the second year running , The Wrigley Company Foundation has remained strongly committed to this program . As an organization , we are not only keen on replenishing smiles but also creating a lasting impact on the communities we live with , \" said Mars Wrigley Confectionery 's Corporate Affairs Director for Africa Wanja Mwangi . In addition to undertaking basic procedures likes simple fillings , fluoride therapy , fissure sealants and extractions among others , the program will also be referring complex cases to nearby public dental facilities . Some 43.6 per cent of five-year-old children had experienced dental caries . These children had a decayed , missing , and filled teeth ( Dmft ) of 1.87 meaning each child had an average of two decayed teeth ; while 18.9 pc of children sampled reported missing school due to a tooth related problem . Another 27.8 pc avoided smiling because they were embarrassed by their teeth ."

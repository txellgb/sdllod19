Idris Elba is starring in a new sitcom that finds him as a live in babysitter . As spotted on Vibe the Golden Globe award winner will play a washed up DJ trying to get his life together in Turn Up Charlie . In the trailer Elba 's character is clearly on a career slump until he reconnects with an old friend who is married to a world famous DJ . Days later he gets a call from his buddy with an offer for work with his star wife but the opportunity has nothing to do with music . To rebuild his struggling music career he takes a nanny job watching over their 11-year-old daughter . Providing childcare is clearly out of the life long bachelor 's wheelhouse which provides the basis of the humorous plot . The series also stars Piper Lisa Perabo and JJ Feild ; Elba also serves as an executive producer . Turn Up Charlie will debut on Netflix on March 15 with eight episodes slotted for the first season .

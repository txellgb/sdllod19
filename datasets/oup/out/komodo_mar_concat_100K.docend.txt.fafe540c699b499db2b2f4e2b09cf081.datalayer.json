    "text": "The founder of the Sussex Guild , recently awarded a British Empire Medal ( BEM ) for services to the crafts , has died aged 92 . Sam Fanaroff died peacefully at his home in Westham on February 16 , according to his loved ones . Westham Founder of Sussex Guild receives honour for his services to craftspeople In a moving tribute to Mr Fanaroff , Jonathan Chiswell Jones on behalf of The Sussex Guild called him \" an inspiration \" to craft workers . He said , \" The Sussex Guild recently celebrated its 50th anniversary and is a lasting testimony to the idealism , vision and determination of its founder . We mourn his passing and celebrate his example . \" Mr Fanaroff moved to Britain in 1950 . Mr Chiswell said , \" In post-war London , which he called his university , he met anarchist thinkers who affected the course of a long creative life . \" In 1965 Sam and his wife Mary Jo joined another family in Westham to live a communal life off the land and by the work of their hands . After the birth of their son David they moved from their caravan to a cottage in Hailsham . \" Sam spent his working life as a coppersmith in Westham completing church commissions as well as doing repair work and creating one off pieces , which earned him an international reputation . \" Mr Fanaroff 's idea for The Guild of Sussex Craftsmen came to him during an exhibition at Michelham Priory in the 1970s . It was set up to combat the isolation of craftworkers and to foster friendship and cooperation . The Queen 's Birthday Honours list celebrated Mr Fanaroff with a BEM for his efforts just last summer . Speaking to the Herald at the time , he said , \" It came out the blue , I had no idea . You do your work and never think in terms of my reward . \" So many people have benefitted from its existence ."

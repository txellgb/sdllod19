    "text": "Bruno Mars , Ariana Grande and Ed Sheeran are among those whose songs have been banned in Indonesia , during daylight hours , over being sexually explicit . Out of all the singers to forbid , they chose Ed Sheeran ? And the Uptown Funk singer was having absolutely none of it , blaming pal Ed for the block . Taking to Twitter , the 33-year-old vowed he had been nothing but ' wholesome ' , joking the Thinking Out Loud star had a lot to answer for . He told his 42.5 million followers : ' WTF ! ' Thanks Ed . ' \" I 'm in love with the shape of you ? \" Really @edsheeran ? & do n't even get me started on \" Thinking Out Loud . \" Have u no shame ? ' Dear Indonesia , I gave u the wholesome hits \" Nothin On You , \" \" Just The Way You Are , \" & \" Treasure . \" Do n't lump me in with that sexual deviant . ' Oooof shots fired . A broadcasting commission in West Java - a province in Indonesia with around 48million residents - has placed the ban on 85 songs , with Ed 's Shape Of You , Bruno 's Versace On The Floor and That 's What I Like and Ariana 's Love Me Harder making the list . But they 're not the only artists in hot water , with The Killers ' Mr Brightside , Your Song by Rita Ora and Rihanna 's Wild Thoughts also blocked . The Guardian states commission head Dedeh Fardiah reportedly said some lyrics could be interpreted as ' objectifying women as sexual objects ' . While deputy head Rahmat Arifin told Tempo.co : ' What is banned is not the songs , but the lyrics of the songs that contain pornography , pornographic association , and obscenity . ' It has been recommended the songs in question are only played between 10pm and 3am local time , which means you might have to wait a while to have an Ed Sheeran / The Killers rave .

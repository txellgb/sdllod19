    "text": "Jenrry Mejia strikes out side in spring debut , says he can be better than he was with Mets originally appeared on nbcsportsboston.com Formerly banned reliever Jenrry Mejia had a successful return to the mound Thursday as he closed out the Red Sox ' spring 13-5 win over the Nationals . Mejia received a lifetime ban from MLB in 2016 after testing positive for performance-enhancing drugs for the third time . The ex-Mets reliever was reinstated last July and signed with Boston in the offseason . Betts reacts to Harper 's mega-deal In Thursday 's ninth-inning appearance , Mejia struck out the side and walked one batter while showing off an impressive cutter and slider . He was asked after the game whether he believes he can be the same pitcher he was during his time with the Mets . \" Maybe better , \" Mejia said . \" I 'm working hard for it . I 'm 29 , before I was 24 . I think I 'm gon na be better . Mejia still has a long road to make it onto the major league club as his contract does n't include an invite to big-league camp . But if he continues to show the stuff that was put on display on Thursday , he may be able to help out what looks to be a thin bullpen at some point this season ."

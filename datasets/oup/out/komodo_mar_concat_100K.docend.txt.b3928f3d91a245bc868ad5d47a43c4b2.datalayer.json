    "text": "The seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate for January 2019 was 3.9 percent , according to the National Institute of Statistics , a slightly lower figure than the one recorded in December 2018 . However , the process of new job creation seems to have slowed down . According to the National Bank 's monthly report , the job vacancy rate had a slight downward adjustment , but maintains high values . Labour market conditions continue to be tense as companies have issues with recruitment both in terms of quantity ( made worse by the high emigration rate ) as well as in terms of quality ( an acute deficit of highly-qualified workforce ) . The unemployment rate for men was 0.8 percent higher than women 's , according to the INS . The number of unemployed individuals estimated for January was 354,000 - lower than in the previous month ( 359,000 ) and the same month of 2018 ( 403,000 ) ."

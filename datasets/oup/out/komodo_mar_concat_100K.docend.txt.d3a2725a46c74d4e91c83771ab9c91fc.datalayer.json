With the news of 90 's TV star Luke Perry having suffered a devastating stroke , fans are curious about his family - in particular , his oldest son , Jack . And as it turns out , Jack is an independent wrestler in a second-tier league , wrestling under the name \" Jungle Boy Nate Coy . \" Born June 15 , 1997 to Perry and his then-wife , Rachel Minnie Sharp , Jack eschewed his father 's career in showbiz for a career in professional wrestling . By 2015 , as a fresh-faced 18-year-old , he was beginning to work his way up through West Coast Independent leagues , such as Los Angeles ' Underground Empire Wrestling ( UEW ) . There , according to Last Word On Pro Wrestling writer Jamie Greer , he worked with more experienced wrestlers such as Peter Avalon and Human Tornado , honing his craft . Like most professional wrestlers , Jungle Boy/Jack Perry has had to slug it out in the minor leagues and work his way up . In Jack 's case , it was in SoCal and even Mexican minor-league wrestling circuits such as Revolution Pro Wrestling USA ( RPW ) , Maverick Pro , and Gold Rush Pro Wrestling ( GRPW ) . He even worked in Mexico , for Ultimo Dragon 's promotion Toryumon Mexico , competing at DragonMania XIII in May 2018 . Just how hard did Jungle Boy have to work at paying his dues ? As Too Fab reported in January 2017 , dad Luke Perry was caught by paparazzi at an Underground Empire Wrestling event , cheering on his son in a barren L.A. industrial building , surrounded by less than a dozen fans . Dad Luke , for his part , was enthusiastically cheering on his son . His hard work seems to have paid off : in 2016 he earned the UEW West Coast Bruiser Cup , and by 2017 he 'd signed with All Pro Wrestling ( APW ) , where as of November 2018 he 'd earned the title APW Junior Heavyweight Champion , wrestling as \" Jungle Boy \" - without the \" Nate Coy \" part . Now , it appears that Jungle Boy/Jack is continuing to advance in his professional wrestling career . As Wrestling News World reported in January , the young wrestler signed with Jacksonville , Florida-based All Elite Wrestling ( AEW ) . In fact , so interested was the second-tier wrestling league in the young star that they reportedly offered him a lengthy contract , but Jack 's management team , which at the time included his father , decided that a contract longer than two years could limit his options for career growth . As of this writing , AEW exists only in a Jacksonville business office , though they 've signed some considerable talent . According to Sports Illustrated , big names attached to the circuit include SoCal Uncensored ( Christopher Daniels , Scorpio Sky , and Frankie Kazarian ) , Dr. Britt Baker , Joey Janela , \" Hangman \" Adam Page , Pac , and Chris Jericho . The first two AEW matches are Double or Nothing , to be held May 25 in Las Vegas , and Fight for the Fallen , with a venue and date to be determined . It remains unclear if Jungle Boy Nate Coy will perform at either of them ."

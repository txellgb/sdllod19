    "text": "Lady Gaga is denying rumors that she is dating Bradley Cooper that have amplified following the couple 's intimate performance at the Oscars . Gaga appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live ( per TV Line ) and rolled her eyes when she was asked about the performance and speculation the co-stars are involved . \" First of all , social media , quite frankly , is the toilet of the Internet , and what it has done to pop culture is just abysmal , \" Gaga said . That 's what we wanted you to see ... This is a love song . The movie A Star Is Born is a love story ... Gaga added that she let Cooper take charge of the performance , having been the director of the film . \" Everything that you saw -- the way that it was shot , the way that they pushed the piano out [ and ] you saw them put the piano together , us walk up on stage , no intro -- that was all him , \" she said . There have been a host of rumors that the Gaga and Cooper are involved , particularly after Gaga announced her split from her fiancee of two years , Christian Carino ."

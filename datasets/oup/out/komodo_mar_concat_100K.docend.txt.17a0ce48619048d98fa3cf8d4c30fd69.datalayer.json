    "text": "Last Saturday 's Presidential and National Assembly elections have come and gone with the victors celebrating , while the losers lick their wounds and ponder the next move to remain relevant till the next four years.While the elections were holding , some comical , humane and sometimes funny activities went on , ranging from the unimaginable to the bizarre.Across the country , there were tales of absurd and unthinkable scenes and incidents within and outside polling/collation centres by people of various ages , socio-economic and political strata abound . Entrepreneurship Of The Average Nigerian On Display By Daniel Anazia , Ijeoma Thomas-Odia and Maria Diamond The Executive Director of Partners West Africa , Nigeria ( PWAN ) , Kemi Okenyodo , was struck by the \" economy \" around the elections , where the entrepreneurial nature of Nigerians was glaring , as they sold kunu , soft drinks , buns and rented chairs for voters to seat , among others . \" As an observer in the field , I saw how people were also disenfranchised . They had their voters ' cards , they checked their names , using the links provided by CSO and INEC and their names were not on the physical register . \" There was a young woman who was with a three-month-old baby , who told me she left home about 8:00 am and about 3:00 pm , she was going back home disappointed after going to six polling units in Gwarimpa and was not able to vote . Her case was not an isolated case , as there were quite a number of people with similar experiences . \" For human rights lawyer with the Women Advocates Research and Documentation Centre ( WARDC ) , who was an election observer , Mrs. Bukky Afolabi-Osidibo : \" One thing that stood out for me was when I wanted to administer a questionnaire on a man who had casted his vote and after exchanging pleasantries with him and asked if he had voted , he responded by showing me the inked part of his finger with a positive affirmation . \" When I said I had some questions for him , he said if I will offer him money , as he will not say a word free , adding : ' I will be 60 years the same year Nigeria will be 60 , I do n't have any support from anyone or government . I am a mechanic , there should be some money set aside to buy tools for people like us to help our businesses and give us space to do our work , so we can provide adequately for our family without having to depend on anyone for survival . \" Go back and tell them that is what I said and that is what we need . \" For some voters at polling units in Oke-Afa Ilamoshe Estate Isolo area of Lagos , it was a time to make new friends . Ikenna Igwe said : \" I was excited about the scenario of the exercise , as I met people of like minds . I remember reminiscing the entire incident of the day while in bed later at night . \" There was this older man , who , while we were waiting and the INEC officials were trying to settle in and get started , but were whispering something amongst themselves , looking disturbed , screamed in Igbo language : \" Bia nde INEC ( come INEC officials ) , whatever you people want to discuss , say it out loud for everyone to hear , whatever you are whispering is not solely your business ; it is everyone 's business . N'gwanu ( alright ) , speak out . \" He beckoned to them and everyone supported him and we all insisted they told us what the problem was ; that the ballot paper had not arrived , but the truth was that they actually forgot it . So , we insisted nobody would cast any vote there that day unless they had everything needed available for free and fair elections , \" he said . Okwanuzo Nwanneri , a 27-year-old lady , described her experience as one-in-a-lifetime . \" I came back from Delta State to Lagos just to vote , because I registered in Lagos before my cousin helped me with a job in Delta and I moved there . For some reasons , I could n't change my voting location , so I decided to seize the opportunity to also see my parents here in Lagos . \" However , at the polling unit , I met my first boyfriend . We lost contact after secondary school when he had to go abroad to study and , as God would have it , he also came back to Nigeria for a break and decided to follow his dad to the polling unit . \" We were both so excited and he introduced me to his dad . He insisted I go with him to their house after voting and I did . The next day , Sunday , he called and came over to my parent 's house and asked if I was in any serious relationship and the answer of course was a ' no ' and that was it . He asked me to marry him and I accepted without hesitation . \" So , I will never forget last Saturday , because it changed my story . \" At the popular Sansiro field located on Joseph Adegboye Street in Isuti , Igando , a Lagos suburb , as early as 7:00 am , youths of eligible voting age gathered at the football playing ground to play what is well known as ' set . ' When The Guardian approached some of them to know if they would vote , they said there was no point voting as the winner had already been decided . As one of them , who simply identify him as Deola , put it : \" There is no point going to waste my time queuing to vote when the winner is already known . \" Whether I vote or not , the INEC knows who will win , because the election will be rigged . Again , those we vote for do n't even know us , but here we know ourselves and this only thing ( football ) that unites us as people . \" In Alapere area of Agboyi , Ketu , a man in his late 50s , in a comical way like a town crier , called out residents to come out and exercise their voting rights . In Rivers , Survival Instinct Is Key By Chuks Nwanne SOMEHOW , every Tom , Dick and Harry knew the presidential election in Rivers State was going to be crises-ridden . Indeed , it was one of the easiest predictions ahead the 2019 elections ; history repeated itself as lives were lost . For residents of Rivers State , electoral violence has become almost normal , it 's no longer dreaded over there ; survival instinct is key . Having experienced the scenario over and over , residents seem to have mastered the act of surviving Rivers election . In fact , in the midst of the usual confusion is an opportunity to make brisk money , though not for the lily-livered . Take away Lagos , if there 's any other hustling city in Nigeria , it must be the oil city of Port Harcourt , the Garden City . Unlike the days regular airport taxis held passengers ransom with their high fare in the name of being in a union , this election period was entirely different ; most residents turned overnight taxi drivers , the hustle is real . \" Oga , I will carry you , just small money , \" they pleaded , as passengers made their way out of the arrival hall . In Port Harcourt , almost everybody is a political analyst . And if you really want to get inside gist of the political situation in Rivers , just strike up a friendly conversation with a taxi driver , you will be shocked how much they know . Do n't go there and claim ' Mr Know-it - all , ' just show some level of interest and you will be furnished with all details ; you will hear the ' Genesis and Revelation ' of Rivers politics . \" Amaechi created the problem in Rivers APC , that 's why they do n't have candidates for this election . If not , it would have been tough ; Wike has upper hand now because the court has stopped APC . If not , it would have be bloody , \" Nathaniel , the taxi driver said on the way out of the airport . Do n't ever under estimate taxi drivers when it comes to information gathering ; their news is usually authentic . \" Last week , I carried some women to the airport and they were discussing politics ; I think they are politicians . From their conversation , I knew this presidential election is going to be difficult because Amaechi now has federal might . I heard a lot of things from the women on our way to the airport . When I dropped them , they ' blessed ' me well , well . We had negotiated for N3000 , but they gave me N5000 . Oga , I hope you will bless me too , \" he said jokingly . Talk of vote buying , it was real in Port Harcourt ; both parties did as confirmed by some residents , who spoke to The Guardian . \" Ah , my friends have sold their votes already . If I take you to my street now , you will see them ; some buy for N5000 or N6000 . But they will snap your PVC and use it to monitor you on Election Day , \" Charles , a resident of Port Harcourt revealed . Asked if he also sold his vote , the young chap said , \" No , I 'm waiting till election day . By that time , the price will come up to like N10 ,000 ; it happened last time . So , I will wait because those that waited during the last election got more money , \" he declared.No matter how rough elections are in the Garden City , street traders would always earn good pay , especially food vendors that operated around the INEC offices and polling units . Though provision was made for the feeding of security men guarding the INEC office on Aba Road , most officers patronised local food vendors by the heavily guarded gate . And when an officer teased one of the vendors on voting , the woman , who had two of her daughters helping out , said , ' which election ? Will that pay my children 's school fees ? Whether you vote or you do n't vote , politicians will always have their way . Na dis one be my election o ; I have a family to feed , \" she said.Come to think of it , who actually recruits Domestic Observers ? Well , maybe not all , but the ones at Governor Wike 's polling unit really ' observed ' for their pockets . As soon as the governor , who voted alongside his wife at PU 007 , ward 9 , in Obio/Akpor Local council , made his way back home , the youth sang his praises , even as he acknowledged cheers from his people . \" Dimgba of Africa , \" they chanted , even as his security operatives ensured nobody came too close . While the hailing lasted , the Domestic Observers mobilised themselves in a small group , waiting for His Excellency to get done with the youths , who obviously needed to be \" blessed . \" Meanwhile , a certain poor woman , who seems to be very popular in the community , had been making frantic effort to attract the attention of Governor Wike . In fact , at a point , the woman , who appeared to be having some challenges , made attempt to pull Wike on his immaculate white native outfit , but the security men prevented her . In fact , one of them , who appeared overzealous actually pushed the woman away . While the drama lasted , Wike has his eyes on the woman and even assured her of ' blessing . ' Just as he promised , the Governor pulled two bundles of N1000 notes and another bundle of N500 note from his aides and handed over to the poor woman . You need to see her joy , as she took to her heels in excitement , heading straight home.By the time ' blessing ' came for the Domestic Observers ' , who were dressed in their brown jackets , the atmosphere became charged . As soon as the observer that got the ' blessing ' made his away out of the scene , he was besieged by other observers , who closed down on him to ensure a group ' blessing ' does n't turn into a one man 's show . Out of sight , the ' blessing ' was shared , even as the polling unit was without any Domestic Observer . Voters ' Entertained ' After Casting Votes IN Abia State , many people were seen inquiring about the location of their polling units and where to collect their Permanent Voter Cards ( PVC ) on election day , even as others claimed they lost their PVCs on their way to the polling centres . Oge Anyanwu , who misplaced his PVC , thought as a registered voter , he would be identified in the voters register and allowed to vote when he arrived the polling unit where he voted during the last election . \" This was why I went with my driver 's license that would identify me , but the presiding officers did not allow me to vote , \" he lamented . At Ogele in Isiala Ngwa Council , Nze Kamalu , who wanted to be sure his wife voted the way their larger family members agreed , was not allowed to watch her cast her vote , and he refused to vote until he was persuaded to do so and to allow his wife vote according to her will.It was reported that some voters , after casting their votes , trooped to the residences of those they claimed they voted for to announce that they voted in their favour , where they were \" entertained , \" an action that spurred more voters to troop in to get their own \" entertainment . \" Security agents swooped on the politician 's residence , thinking illegal polling was taking place there , but after searching the entire house and finding nothing incriminating , collected their own \" entertainments \" and left . The Day Akpabio ' Sweated ' For Votes From Anietie Akpan , Uyo IN his Ukana West Ward 2 in Essien Udim Council of Akwa Ibom State , immediate past governor and ex-Senate Minority Leader , Godswill Akpabio , is revered by many like a tin-God and a giver.So , when he arrived his ward about 11.30 am last Saturday to vote , the crowd of voters , community people , mostly women , journalists , domestic and foreign observers , and of course , security men milled around him . Akpabio and his wife , Unoma , voted at about noon and while his wife left , he tarried awhile , remaining in his car for almost an hour , probably making calls , even as the crowd of community women and few others stood round his black SUV from a distance.In previous elections , Akpabio left the vicinity once through with voting , but this February 23 was different , as he stayed behind till collation was over around 8.15 pm . Within that period , the crowd kept on following him like bees wherever he trekked to within the Independent High School compound , venue of the election . Once in a while , he chatted them up and at a point he went to sit under a tree , watching what was going on , with his security aides standing beside him . The crowd as usual expected the boisterous Akpabio to dole out cash , but this was not so , as the electoral law forbids anyone from carrying over N2 , 000 at venue of election . While Akpabio was waiting , something strange happened . Voting had ended by 2:00 pm , but counting and collation did not commence until about 4:00 pm . Following cases of snatching of ballot boxes and stuffing , it took hours before the INEC ad-hoc staff , assisted by APC and PDP chieftains and parties ' agents could reconcile the new figures that were higher than the total number of accredited voters before the result was announced about 8.15 pm.After hours of keeping voters , journalists and observers waiting in the course of trying to put their acts right , the Presiding Officer finally released the results of the three units , with APC candidates wining all . Another behind the scenes activities and the news behind the news was one of Akpabio 's words on marble that have gone virile . In one of the campaign ceremonies , just few days to election , Akpabio boasting in English mixed with his local Annang dialect , said : \" If I fail to deliver 90 per cent of the local governments for APC , if I die , do n't bury me in Ukana my village . \" I can confidently tell you that election in Akwa Ibom will last for three hours . In fact , I will make sure that APC wins at all level within three hours . PDP died the day I left them . Chai , Mbom PDP ( I pity PDP ) yes , I pity them , especially Udom . I put him there and I will remove him . ( He cried mockingly and raised a song ) Kop ntuagha ke PDP , Kop ntuagha ke PDP . Akpabio asio ukot Udom onyong idung , kop ntuagha ke PDP ( meaning , listen as they weep in PDP , see as they weep in PDP , when Akpabio raises his leg , immediately , Udom relocates to his village ) . \" If my gateman disobeys me , do you expect me to start exchange words with my gateman ? I will just sack him straight away . By the time I finish with PDP , they will know I am Akpabio . \" So , when he finally lost the election , some persons used the same song above to mock him by just changing the names . For instance , in the first line where you have PDP , they substituted APC and where you have Akpabio , they called Ukarakpa ( an alias for Chris Ekpenyong , who defeated Akpabio ) and where you have Udom , they put Akpabio . In Calabar , as the new style of vote , snap and come for your money was uncovered , despite the ban of phones at polling centres , another method of payment was introduced . At Edem Otop and many other areas in Calabar , some persons hid themselves in a corner , paying out money to voters before they went in and vote . Some voters had to leave the queue of one of the two presidential candidates that was giving N500 to another that was dishing out N1 , 000 per person . AT a polling unit in Calabar Municipal Council , an old man of about 80 years , after thumb-printing on his ballot papers , wanted to leave with the presidential ballot paper and when directed by the agents to drop it in the ballot box , he was reluctant and held tightly to it . When asked why , he said he only came there to vote for a senate candidate . Mrs. Mercy Edosa , a voter who stayed in the queue with her husband for four hours before voting , lamented voter turnout , complaining : \" Imagine a woman who was at the same polling unit with me , she was not there to vote , but to watch what was going on and at the end of everything , she said to me , ' madam , abeg who win ? ' I asked her : \" Did you vote ? ' she said , no o ! \" She wanted one of the candidates to win , but she never made any attempt to give him her one vote . It is a pity , we need to learn from this , \" she said . ' See And Buy ' Maxim Reigns In Ondo ONDO State , where the \" see and buy \" maxim found its way into Nigerian politics during the 2015 House of Assembly poll , experienced low cash transfer and transaction during the polls across the 203 wards and 3,009 units , where Dibo ko sebe , meaning ' vote and cook soup , was a popular slogan.According to findings , heavy monetisation of the electoral process reduced drastically due to the voting pattern , which shielded the voters from any possibility of displaying the party they voted for to a waiting party merchant who was ready to pay them for the vote ."

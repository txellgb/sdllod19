    "text": "The Catholic Church 's body for migrants in the Philippines on March 1 , 2019 , urged help for stateless persons , a \" disturbing \" global phenomenon affecting thousands of Filipino children . Restituto Ogsimer , executive secretary of the bishops ' Commission on Migrants and Itinerant People , said that church people must advocate for the rights of stateless people . Just like the way it responds to the asylum seekers and refugees in the Philippines , he said the church is looking and must continue to find ways to assist these children . \" We are the church , let us act now , seek them out and extend our hands the farthest it can reach to care for them , to embrace them and to make them feel loved and recognize their existence in our midst , \" Ogsimer wrote in his message for the National Migrants ' Sunday to be observed on March 10 . According to him , statelessness challenges both the church of origin and the receiving churches , stressing the need for a vigorous campaign to mainstream the discourse on the issue . He also emphasized the need for policies and laws to recognize and promote \" just treatment \" and to provide basic material needs for them especially the young ."

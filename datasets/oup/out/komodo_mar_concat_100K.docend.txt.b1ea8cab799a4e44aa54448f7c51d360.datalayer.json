    "text": "The release date for DanMachi Season 2 has finally been confirmed to be coming up in 2019 ! The announcement concerning the second season of Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon ? ( Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no ha Machigatteru Darou ka ) was made during a special cast/staff screening event of the DanMachi movie Arrow Of The Orion , which premiered in Japanese theaters on February 15 . The animation staff and cast have not been announced yet , but presumably animation studio J.C. Staff will return for DanMachi Season 2 . In the first season , Yoshitsugu Matsuoka voiced Bell Cranel , Inori Minase portrayed Hestia , and Saori Oonishi was Ais Wallenstein . This article provides everything that is known about DanMachi Season 2 and all related news . Sentai Filmworks is releasing the DanMachi movie in U.S. theaters in addition to screenings in North America , United Kingdom , Australia , Taiwan , Hong Kong , South Korea , Singapore , Malaysia , Indonesia , Philippines , and Thailand . The exact timing for the English dub Arrow Of The Orion release date has not yet been announced . The Arrow Of The Orion story was written by series creator Fujino Omori . Voice actors Yoshitsugu Matsuoka and Inori Minase returned as Bell and Hestia . \" Hestia is the first heroine I 've played in a TV anime , \" said Inori Minase , who plays Hestia . \" I 'm so happy to break into the big screen with her . \" The newest DanMachi character is the blue-haired goddess Artemis , who is the head of the Artemis Familia known for being a perfect shot with the bow . This goddess is also known for her chastity and forbids romance within her familia . Anyone desiring to be in a relationship is required to quit the familia . \" I 'm playing a new character who appears for the first time , so I 'm both nervous and excited to see how everyone will react to her , \" said Maaya Sakamoto , who voices Artemis in the Japanese release . DanMachi Season 2 was initially announced alongside the Arrow Of The Orion movie , but it seems like the voice actors are already teasing DanMachi Season 3 . \" The fact that the film was timed at this stage makes me think that this series will continue for a long while yet . I think it 's a message to all the fans , \" said Welf voice actor Yoshimasa Hosoya . The DanMachi light novels were written by Fujino Omori and illustrated by Suzuhito Yasuda . As of December 15 , 2018 , the books were up to Volume 14 and it 's possible DanMachi Volume 15 and 16 could come out in 2019 ( the release dates have n't been officially announced yet ) . Yen Press is publishing the English translation of the Dungeon ni Deai o Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru no Daro ka ? light novel series North America . As of October 30 , 2018 , the official English translations reached Is It Wrong To Try To Pick Up Girls In A Dungeon ? Volume 12 . DanMachi Volume 13 is scheduled to release on March 19 , 2019 , while Volume 14 is set for August 20 , 2019 . There are two major spinoffs of the main story , with Familia Chronicle being comprised of only Episode Ryuu so far . The more substantial spinoff , Sword Oratoria , focuses on the adventures of Ais Wallenstein and is already up to Volume 11 . The story has already received a single season anime adaptation that covered the first four books . Yen Press publishes an English translation of the spinoff Sword Oratoria light novels under the title Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon ? All three stories are being adapted into DanMachi manga series . The main story for the manga is being written by Omori himself and illustrated by Kunieda . As of January 22 , the English translation and the Japanese version of the manga were both up to Volume 10 , which ends with Chapter 86 . The ending of DanMachi Season 1 finished off in a climactic moment , with Bell Cranel using his special ability to overwhelm a goliath-level boss creature . Episode 13 corresponds to the ending of DanMachi Volume 5 , which partially explains why the wait for DanMachi Season 2 has been so long . Back in 2015 when the first season released , author Omori was only up to DanMachi Volume 8 . A year and a half later the books were already up to Volume 11 , but the producers first focused on adapting the Sword Oratoria light novels and then creating the original movie . The good news is that there is plenty of source material for creating DanMachi Season 2 without resorting to filler episodes . English-only fans can already read ahead in the light novels right now and get an idea of what the second season will be like . The bad news is the number of episodes . If DanMachi Season 2 maintains the same pacing as the first season , then Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon ? Season 2 will probably be a single-cour season composed of 13 episodes . ( This information is not confirmed and will be updated . ) What 's more , DanMachi manga readers ca n't read ahead since manga Volume 10 finally caught up with the first season of the anime . However , the second half of Chapter 85 starts what will be the beginning of DanMachi Season 2 . As of the last update , Warner Bros. , J.C. Staff , or any company related to the production of the anime has not officially confirmed the exact DanMachi Season 2 release date . The production of a sequel was announced in 2018 . In February 2019 , it was confirmed that the second season will come out during the summer 2019 anime season . Therefore , the DanMachi Season 2 premiere date will likely occur in July 2019 . Audiences expecting adventurers to be entering a new level of the dungeon will have to wait a bit since the danger and intrigue all take place on the surface of the Labyrinth City Oraria at the beginning of DanMachi Season 2 . But , first , there is some partying ! Three days after returning from floor 18 , the story begins with Bell and his party celebrating their victory at the Hibachitei bar , which was teased during the end credits scene of Episode 13 . Celebration turns into brawling when the Hestia Familia is insulted by Luan Espel of the Apollo Familia . Bell ca n't contain himself and attacks Luan , causing everyone to take sides in the fight . But after the bar fight is over it 's pretty apparent that Luan had lured Bell into the fight and witnesses had been bribed . The party spills into the next day , but now it 's Apollo hosting the God 's Banquet , a special celebration where the gods can bring one member of their familia with them . Bell is Hestia 's only Familia member and it turns out Loki brings Ais to the banquet . When Hestia and Loki launch into an argument , Hermes decides to have some mischief by arranging for Bell and Ais to have their very first formal dance together . Neither knew how to dance , but with advice from Takemikazuchi and Mikoto they are able to enjoy themselves . When Apollo arrives at the banquet he announced to everyone gathered that he plans on challenging Hestia to a War Game , a proxy battle in which gods settle disputes by pitting their children against each other in a form battle . A War Game is settled through a variety of options like castle siege or a duel where the winner gets to demand anything of the other god . It 's a decidedly stacked challenge since Apollo has over 100 Familia members , including a level 3 captain . Panicked , Hestia grabs Bell and runs from the banquet . The next morning opens with a bang when the Apollo Familia launches an attack on Bell and Hestia 's home under the old church . Their home is destroyed by flames and friends are hurt during the assault . On the run , Hestia confesses her feelings for Bell and says they can run away together , but Bell merely responds by saying that he respected her . Gathering courage , Hestia decides to confront Apollo in his own home . She takes Luan 's glove and throws it in Apollo 's face , thereby accepting his challenge to the War Game . In deciding the terms , Apollo declared that he would take Bell if he won , but if Hestia won \" she can have anything her little heart desires . \" Apollo did n't think there was any chance of losing and was already fantasizing over how he would sexually abuse Bell . But events did not go as Apollo expected . Even as Bell begins training with Ais and the Amazonian sister Tiona in preparation for the War Game , others began working in the background and intrigue and betrayal rule the city . Without getting into too many spoilers , let 's just say Bell and friends of the Hestia Familia manage to shock everyone during the War Game by using cunning and strategy . With victory secured , Hestia dissolved the Apollo Familia , confiscated all of its assets including Apollo 's mansion , and banned Apollo from ever setting foot in Orario again . Bell even levels up once again to level 3 , breaking another speed record . While it sounds like they 're all ready to live the good life in the mansion , it turns out the Hestia Familia owes 200 million valis to Hephaestus . Then a series of events leads to Bell visiting the brothels of the Entertainment District and poor Bell finds himself at the mercy of Hermes ' shenanigans ... and an aphrodisiac . Bell 's luck turns even worse when he ends up needing to run from a crowd of Ishtar Familia Amazonesses . Trying to hide , Bell accidentally becomes friends with a prostitute named Haruhime after she mistakenly though Bell was a customer . Needless to say , Bell had a difficult time explaining all this to Hestia the following day and ends up being punished . Bell sets his mind on freeing Haruhime from her owners the Ishar Familia , but this quest is complicated by an illegal magical item called the Killing Stone ... never mind quest requests and a dungeon ambush ! Events quickly spiral out of control when Freya decides to invade the Entertainment District to go after the Ishtar Familia . In the end , Bell is forced to fight for Haruhime 's freedom to save her from a ritual involving the Killing Stone . Goddesses clash on rooftops and the battle results in a familia being dissolved when a goddess is forced back to heaven in order to preserve her life . Volume 8 seemingly starts with the grim prospect of total war since the war god Ares is coming to town once again with his Rakia army . But the citizens of Orario are not too worried since they have a dungeon and thus strong adventurers . Is n't it said that love and war go together ? Even as there are invading armies , Bell thinks about how he is in love with Ais while Hestia hopes to make Bell fall for her one day . Bell already has a volunteer harem starting since Haruhime would be perfectly fine being Bell 's mistress . Little Lili also has feelings for Bell and is surprised to learn that he is in love with Ais . Relationships are always messy and blonde-haired Finn Demne of the Loki familia ends up asking for Lili 's hand in marriage . The situation grows more complicated when Bell and Finn decide to duel over Lili . Much of this book could be considered side stories showcasing the various characters of the DanMachi world during the war with the Rakia . But it 's the epilogue which sets up the next stage of the story when a dragon girl is born in a new area of the dungeon called the Large Tree Labyrinth . The poor monster is attacked by adventurers and other monsters and is in despair for her life when she happens to stumble upon a certain white-haired boy . Bell was surprised to see a monster crying and decided to leave the young female alone but was shocked further when the monster actually spoke . Bell then decides to save the monster girl from other adventurers and sneaks her out of the dungeon . The discovery of an intelligent monster is shocking but Hestia decides to help . Bell gives the monster girl the name Welusine but it is shortened to Wiene . Despite the best efforts to keep Wiene a secret , rumors of the monster girl start spreading . A mysterious mission given to the Hestia Familia has everyone traveling to floor 20 . There , they find the Guild head Ouranos , who reveals there is a hidden village for intelligent monsters , which is called Xenos . Ouranos hopes that Hestia Familia might become the bridge which allows monsters and humans to co-exist . The revelation of the Xenos was still fresh when some of the intelligent monsters go out of control and take up arms in a mass migration that threatens humans . Bell must stand in the gap between humanity and monsters and try to save all . Unfortunately , anime fans will have to wait until the DanMachi Season 2 release date to watch how Bell resolves this crisis . Thankfully , we do n't have to wait too long ; let 's just hope Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon ? Season 3 follows soon after ."

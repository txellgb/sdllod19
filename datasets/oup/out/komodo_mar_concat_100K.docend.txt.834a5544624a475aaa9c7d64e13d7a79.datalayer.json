Top government sources told our reporters that the broadcast was an \" arrangement \" to convince the electorate in the state , after the fallout of the defeat of the ruling All Progressives Congress ( APC ) in the presidential and National Assembly elections . Apparently in a panic mode ahead of the state House of Assembly election , Rotimi Akeredolu , Governor of Ondo State , is billed to address a state broadcast on Friday . The broadcast is slated to be aired on the state government-owned media station , the Ondo State Radio-Vision Corporation ( OSRC ) and Orange Fm 94.5 , Akure . The state broacast has been fixed for 7pm , it was gathered . \" Do n't mind the white-bearded man . The idea was given to him by some persons in our government and I pity the Governor , because he does n't know anything about politics , \" a source in his government said . It is obvious that Akeredolu has lost grip on the people . He worked against the party in the last poll by asking people to vote for AA . So , I am sure he would lose the state . \" A copy of the broadcast speech seen by our correspondent revealed the Governor 's plans to appeal to the people to \" see the state House of Assembly election as a family affair and vote for the candidates whose campaign promises are in line with his vision \" . Already , Akeredolu has been meeting with the people , pleading with them to vote his candidates in the APC . The Governor is also billed to meet with all cadres of state government workers on Monday at Adegbemile Cultural Centre in Akure ."

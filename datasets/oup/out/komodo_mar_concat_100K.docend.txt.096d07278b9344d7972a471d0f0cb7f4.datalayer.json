    "text": "After days of painful debate , the traditionalist coalitions won a vote that has divided our house . By a 53 percent majority , the church strengthened its ban on queer marriage and clergy -- and it toughened punishments for those who defy that doctrine . When we arrived in St. Louis for the conference , many of the queer clergy and laity and our allies were optimistic , despite our denomination 's disputes about the Scripture 's teachings about sexuality . 3 options Compared with the Simple Plan ( which would have removed all exclusionary language on homosexuality from the Book of Discipline ) and the Traditional Plan ( which affirms prohibitions against same-sex marriage and gay ordination , with harsher consequences for disobedience ) , it was a moderate path . The atmosphere was strained at the Dome at America 's Center , the stadium where the delegates gathered to hear speeches and cast votes . But there also were instances of soaring love . Yet when the initial legislative council votes were taken Feb. 25 , on the second day of voting , the traditionalists revealed themselves to be unaffected . For days on end , on the floor and over meal breaks , we 'd been making ourselves vulnerable to people who told us to our faces that we were unfaithful to the Scriptures and a danger to the church -- people who denied that we were worthy to preach in the pulpit or be wed at the altar . Lifelong fight Yet as I studied the Scriptures , this time as a pastor , I understood that it was possible for God , far from condemning my sexuality , to call me into a loving relationship . That 's the irony : While traditionalists claim that progressives reject Scripture , many of us have spent uncountable hours poring over the Bible 's every line . Leaders from the Western Jurisdiction , on the other hand , have declared their commitment to inclusivity , regardless of the cost : They reaffirmed their support of the full inclusion of our siblings who are LBGBTQIA and queer pastors like myself as we serve and lead . I put on my collar and served Holy Communion to all those who sought it . Many of them are already acquainted with struggle -- they 're living in the country illegally , or putting themselves through school , or enduring the effects of racism and discrimination against black and indigenous people in this country -- and they know how to be brave . Bonner is the director of Frontera Wesley , a campus ministry at the University of Arizona ."

    "text": "Where BioWare could go next following the disappointment of Anthem . From the outside looking in , BioWare has had a tough time of it lately . Over four years since Inquisition , we 've only had one recent teaser for a fourth Dragon Age , despite the last game being the studio 's most successful launch in its history . Mass Effect Andromeda was to most players a disappointment , with its planned DLC never seeing the light of day . Anthem , meanwhile , does n't feel ready for launch -- it 's a slight-feeling game that does n't invoke the same excitement the studio 's previous series did . Counterpoint : The Old Republic ticks away in the background . BioWare 's games have always been changing . Mass Effect was arguably the last big transition , an RPG shaped primarily for shooter players during an era dominated by Gears of War -- its second and third entries more so . To fans of the cRPGs that made its name , Dragon Age : Origins probably felt like the last gasp of a previously PC-focused studio . Anthem represents another transition -- albeit , a far less successful one -- into the increasingly overpopulated space of shooters that want to keep you playing forever by using loot or cosmetics as an incentive . It was okay for BioWare to want to change again and try something new , but too many of its strengths got buried in this particular attempt to branch out . Pondering BioWare 's future , the most optimistic scenario to me is this : Anthem gets back on track and finds a large enough , steady audience to keep it growing until it reaches its full potential , much like The Division did . Next up , BioWare makes that Dragon Age game we finally got a hint of last year , and it shows everyone it can make a singleplayer RPG on the same level it used to . And after that , almost a decade into the future , these vague promises of a new Mass Effect turn into an actual game that gets people excited about that universe once more . Hopefully , too , there 'd be a few unexpected surprises along the way . The reality will probably turn out pretty differently , but in the short term , the studio has been great at accepting and addressing criticism of Anthem 's flaws like its loot system . It 's been vocal in the additions it plans to make to the game , which is also a positive step . But it remains that BioWare has had a disappointing few years , and that other games are now better at the things it used to do so well . Anthem is disappointing in many tiny ways , but the biggest problem to a long-time BioWare fan is surely how the story is presented . There 's almost no unity between Fort Tarsis , where all of the story content is siloed off , and the world where you fly around with three other players in cool robot armour . The conversations at Tarsis give you few reasons to be invested -- only by the end of the campaign did I start to care about the stories of Faye and Haluk , two of your character 's oldest companions . And at that point , the story was over , feeling like half a game that was padded out with needless side quests . BioWare had the right to make something new -- but Anthem is simply not as good as its other games . The competition and the pretenders I feel like the games around BioWare have thrived while it 's struggled , and that there 's a sense of missed opportunity as a result . Last year , Assassin 's Creed Odyssey brought choices to the series for the first time , in a move undoubtedly inspired by BioWare 's own successful attempts to do so . It 's weird to me that Assassin 's Creed , a series I previously associated with boring main characters and naff plots about real historical figures , has eaten BioWare 's lunch , yet here we are . The strong response to Odyssey 's Kassandra , for example , mirrors the passionate way people used to talk about Mass Effect 's characters . It 's interesting to see how else that open world RPG space has moved on around the studio . Mega-selling PS4 game Horizon : Zero Dawn features character conversations similar to those of Mass Effect . In terms of competitors , The Witcher 3 emerged as the greatest blockbuster RPG of its generation , not long after the arrival of Inquisition . Obsidian , of course , has its roots in cRPGs as well -- and seeing them announce something like The Outer Worlds is exciting because it plays to their traditional strengths . There 's definitely still a place for BioWare to be doing what it does best -- and the announcement of a title-less Dragon Age before Anthem was even released feels like a statement of intent . The reality remains that someone decided to release Anthem last week , when it clearly would have benefitted from extra time . I really hope BioWare 's next project is a huge success -- I think it 's a victim of overwhelming expectations , partly driven by the fact that people have been so emotionally invested in its past games . I 've seen the story told many times about how BioWare turned its back on its history since it moved away from making classic RPGs , onto the action games it 's now best known for . Those games meant a lot to me -- Mass Effect 2 's set of characters had a bigger impact on me than any game from the last decade , and even when Dragon Age 2 trapped me in Kirkwall for tens of hours , BioWare knew how to show me a good time . A lot of years have passed , though , and games are not in the same place they used to be . It 's not fair of me to ask BioWare to make the same games it once did , when the studio itself is bound to have changed in the meantime . I just wish Anthem was better , and that I could get as invested in it as I wanted to be . When trying to predict what happens to BioWare next , I focus on what the studio 's General Manager Casey Hudson outlined as its mission statement in May of last year . \" We create worlds of adventure , conflict , and companionship that inspire you to become the hero of your story . \" To me , Anthem only half-achieved those things . But I hope I 'll someday play another BioWare game that hits all of them at once ."

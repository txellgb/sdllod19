' It will be developing as it goes across the UK and it will be bringing very strong winds . He added that gusts of 55 to 65mph are ' likely quite widely within the warning area and there is the potential for isolated gusts to reach 70 and 80mph ' .

The weekend will also see the return of rain to parts of the United Kingdom , and could even see snow in North-East England and South-East Scotland Wind speeds will be highest in Devon , Cornwall , Wales and north-west England , Mr Madge said . He added : ' On Sunday there will be some strong winds developing by midday for parts of the South West . ' The storm could also see injuries and danger to life from large waves and beach material being thrown onto sea fronts , coastal roads and properties . It comes just days after wildfires broke out across the country on Tuesday after the record-breaking 70F ( 21C ) hottest winter day ever created arid conditions and left fields parched . Firefighters battled blazes in East Sussex , Edinburgh , Saddleworth Moor , in Greater Manchester , and North Wales , as the unprecedented hot February weather continued . Arid conditions caused wildfires to spring up all over the country on Tuesday A huge fire at Saddleworth Moor turned the sky orange and a number of motorists near the blaze reported being able to feel the heat through their windscreens as temperatures soared on Tuesday Park goers enjoy the warm winter weather at St James 's Park in London on Tuesday , the hottest winter day on record Describing the sudden change in temperature , a Met Office spokeswoman told MailOnline : ' During the winter we usually experience windier and colder weather form the west . ' But recently we have been experiencing a period of high pressure in the United Kingdom which has acted as a sort of barrier against this colder weather . And so we 've seen above-average temperatures . ' That has now moved on , and so the weather is returning to normal and we 'll have more wintry temperatures next week . ' Storm Freya is the sixth named storm of the 2018/2019 calendar , and comes after Erik in February and Deirdre in December . Erik left three dead as it wreaked havoc on large parts of the United Kingdom , ripping trees from the ground and causing considerable travel disruption ."

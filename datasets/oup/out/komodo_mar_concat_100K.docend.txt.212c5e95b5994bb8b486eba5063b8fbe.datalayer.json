    "text": "Health minister Steve Brine has said that the result of a second referendum on Brexit would be \" divisive not decisive \" and warned against MPs backing a People 's Vote . The MP for Winchester told talkRADIO 's James Whale : \" We just need to get it done and get out safely . We just need to do the deal . \" I do sense a mood change . I do think the MPs who voted against the withdrawal agreement before on my side are starting to realise that they need to take the prize and know how to win . They won the referendum . \" Mr Brine urged fellow MPs to vote for Theresa May 's EU withdrawal agreement . \" You have people like me voting to trigger Article 50 and voted for the withdrawal act , \" he said . \" Now it is time to vote for a withdrawal agreement . To those colleagues of mine , the message is simple : Take the prize off the shelf because if you do n't it might just disappear . \" The prime minister 's withdrawal agreement was voted down by a significant margin in January , with 432 MPs voting against it . Since then Mrs May has returned to Brussels in the hope of reopening talks and returning to Parliament with an altered deal . The European Commission president Jean Claude-Juncker has stressed that negotiations will not be reopened . Speaking in the European Parliament after Mrs May 's defeat , he said : \" Everyone has to know that the Withdrawal Agreement will not be reopened . \""

    "text": "Bryce Harper reportedly will be calling Philadelphia his home for the next 13 years , and we now know why . The star outfielder reportedly signed a 13-year , $ 330 million deal with the Phillies on Thursday , and his contract does not include opt-outs , but does have a no-trade clause . Harper reportedly fielded some decent offers from the San Francisco Giants and Los Angeles Dodgers -- the latter of which had a massive annual value . But in the end , he settled with the long-term commitment to the Phillies . So , why exactly did Harper go with the Phillies ? His agent , Scott Boras , explained the \" mandate \" he was given by the 26-year-old , and because of that his decision to go with Philly now makes far more sense . There would be some considerable risk in Harper signing a shorter-term deal , especially with how fickle baseball free agency has been the past two seasons . And in signing the deal he did with the Phillies , it 's clear Harper got just what he was looking for , even if he did have to wait a while ."

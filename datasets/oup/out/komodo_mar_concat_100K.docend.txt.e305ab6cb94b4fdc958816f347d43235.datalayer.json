    "text": "A North Bay man who has spent countless nights on the street told social service board members this week they need to get out of their chairs to really see the homelessness problem in North Bay . Robert Walpole frequently relies on the generosity and services of The Warming Centre and Gathering Place for help . \" These services are a lifeline , \" he told the District of Nipissing Social Services Administration Board Wednesday . \" If you do n't think there 's a need , you better think again . \" Walpole said The Warming Centre has kept many people off the streets . However , more beds are needed to meet demand . \" When you 're outside with no place to go in -35 C weather you know you 're in trouble , \" he said . \" I would advise all of you sitting around the table to get down to the street level . People are trying to survive on $ 656 . That amount barely covers their rent so how do they eat and buy clothes ? \" Walpole said people often rent out their room for cash and spend the night in a bank or shelter . \" If you got a place to sleep no matter where it is , do n't give it up . \" Walpole 's presentation came before startling data was presented to the DNSSAB board depicting the problem on North Bay 's streets . Chief administrative officer Joe Bradbury said the number of shelter admissions at the North Bay Crisis Centre has steadily increased from about 500 in 2015 to 700 last year . \" And about half of that increase occurred more recently between 2017 and 2018 , \" he added . Bradbury said the number of days people are staying at the crisis centre increased from 4,300 days in 2015 to 6,500 days last year . He said the numbers indicate people are staying longer in the shelter than they have in past years . Due to the demand for emergency shelter , Bradbury said the crisis centre has seen occupancy reach 100 per cent a number of times throughout the year . In 2015 , the crisis centre had 15 emergency overflow days . But in 2018 , the number reached more than 100 . \" The Crisis Centre of North Bay exhausts all other options before going into this overflow situation and putting people in motel rooms , \" Bradbury said . \" This includes calling all of the other shelters in the district to see if they have room . This tells us that all other shelters in the district are also full at the same time . \" Bradbury said DNSSAB provides Community Homelessness Prevention Initiative ( CHPI ) funding to help keep people from becoming homeless . Last year $ 150,000 was spent to keep people in their homes . \" It 's fairly concerning , \" Bradbury said . \" The fund is currently under review and there 's no certainty what the future of this fund will be . \" Bradbury said to address the situation a small project team has been assembled to conduct a situation analysis . The team is comprised of three DNSSAB staff and five community homelessness service providers with expertise in the area of homelessness . The results will be presented this month ."

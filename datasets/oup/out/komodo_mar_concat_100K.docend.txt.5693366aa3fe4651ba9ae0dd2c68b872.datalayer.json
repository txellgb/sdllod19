    "text": "SZA is totally fine after taking a tumble down some stairs during an Instagram Story session . She was with some friends giving an Instagram tour of a new house when , the fall took place , as TMZ points out . The immediate laughs of those in the clip ( SZA included ) means the tumble was little more than an Instagrammed mishap . \" Hi , I 'm fine , \" SZA is heard telling everyone near the end of the clip . \" I 'm fine , I 'm okay , I promise . \" Some fans were briefly convinced last month that something new from SZA , whose 2018 Kendrick Lamar collab \" All the Stars \" scored Grammy and Oscar noms , would be dropping soon . However , the offending Frank Ocean Tumblr post -- which read , \" March 1st ... SOLANA + KL + ANDRE ... HERE FOR THE BEANS \" -- was later determined most likely to be the result of an unfortunate hack . While we await for new SZA , there 's plenty of comfort to be found in her recent take on the 1998 Sixpence None the Richer radio classic \" Kiss Me . \" The Oscar nominee unveiled her cover of the pop juggernaut during a headlining set at the Ill Point Music Festival in Miami last month . Sadly , the performance was n't immediately followed by a studio version of the update landing on streaming services ."

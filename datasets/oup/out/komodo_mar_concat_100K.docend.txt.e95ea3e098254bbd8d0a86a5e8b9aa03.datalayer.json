    "text": "By Emily Rauhala Emily Rauhala Staff writer covering Canada and foreign affairs March 1 at 2:49 PM Canada will move ahead with the extradition case against Chinese technology executive Meng Wanzhou , paving the way for a legal battle that will pit Canada against China and could complicate the relationship between both countries and the United States . The decision , which was announced Friday , means Canada 's Justice Department believes there is \" sufficient evidence \" to proceed with an extradition hearing . Meng will next appear in a Vancouver court on March 6 , when next steps for the hearing will be set . Meng , who is chief financial officer for China 's Huawei Technologies , was arrested at Vancouver 's airport on Dec. 1 on U.S. charges related to alleged violations of U.S. sanctions law , setting off an ongoing diplomatic dispute . China has repeatedly called on Canada to release Meng . Canada refused , saying the case was a legal not political matter . Not long after , two Canadians in China were arrested on vague security charges . The standoff over Meng 's fate comes as the Trump administration is engaged in tense trade negotiations with Beijing . President Trump at one point suggested that the United States could cut a deal with China to secure Meng 's release . In January , the U.S. Justice Department unsealed a 13-count indictment against Huawei , two affiliates and Meng , alleging bank and wire fraud . It also charged the company with violating U.S. sanctions on Iran . Friday 's announcement from Canadian authorities means the United States will indeed seek to bring Meng stateside to pursue their case . Huawei pleads not guilty to accusations it stole T-Mobile 's trade secrets Just ask these cute singing children ."

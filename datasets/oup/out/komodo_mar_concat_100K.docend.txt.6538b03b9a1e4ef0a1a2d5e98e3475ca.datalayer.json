    "text": "BOISE , Idaho ( AP ) -- For the past 11 years the deaf executive director of the Idaho Council for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing has had to find a sign-language interpreter for meetings with lawmakers . The process can take days , sometimes forcing Steven Snow to miss important meetings on urgent issues . The Idaho Press reports that now , for the first time , legislative budget-writers have approved funding so the council can hire a full-time interpreter . Executive director Steven Snow did n't ask for the funding , but mentioned the issue in response to questions from members of the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee last month . Members of the budget-writing committee were stunned by the situation . On Thursday , Idaho Falls Republican Wendy Horman proposed a budget for next year that includes roughly $ 90,000 for a full-time interpreter .

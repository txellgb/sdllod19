    "text": "Chicago Public Schools CEO Janice Jackson is entitled to six months of pay on her $ 260,000-a-year salary if she 's terminated without cause , plus six months of health insurance for herself and her family . She wo n't need it if Toni Preckwinkle is elected mayor . Preckwinkle said Friday she plans to keep Jackson for two reasons : CPS needs stability after a revolving door of five CEOs in the past eight years and Mayor Rahm Emanuel got it right with his fifth try . \" We 're gon na have some transition in the police department . It 's important to have stability at CPS , \" Preckwinkle told the Chicago Sun-Times . \" I 'm impressed by the fact that she 's a Chicago native . That she worked her way up from a teacher to regional administrator and then head of the schools and that her kids are in the public schools . \" If Jackson agrees to stay , Preckwinkle made it clear she 'll be on Jackson 's case to deliver on the broken promise to re-purpose the 38 schools closed by Mayor Rahm Emanuel that remain vacant . \" We have to heat them . We ca n't let them disintegrate . And they 're very public reminders to the people who live in those neighborhoods that resources were withdrawn from their community , \" Preckwinkle said . \" It 's a slap in the face that we have n't made the effort to try to turn those empty buildings into community resources . We have to make that a priority over the next four years . \" Preckwinkle 's reference to \" transition in the police department \" stems from her mid-December promise to dump Supt. Eddie Johnson for \" refusing to acknowledge there was a code of silence \" in the Chicago Police Department . Mayor Rahm Emanuel famously acknowledged that there is a code of silence in the department in the furor over his handling of the Laquan McDonald shooting video . On Friday , Preckwinkle cracked the door open for Johnson to save his $ 260,004-a-year job just as the department released crime figures for February that showed homicides and shootings continuing to decline . \" I 'm not targeting him . What I 've said is that you have to acknowledge that we have a code of silence in the police department , and the superintendent of police has to acknowledge that that 's the case , \" Preckwinkle said . \" I 'm a history teacher . If you do n't acknowledge your problems , there 's no way you can seriously address them . That 's one . . . . We have to provide better training and supervision for our officers . And the third thing is we have to hold our police department accountable for solving the most serious crimes . . . . We have a 15 percent closure rate for murders . The national average is , what , 62 percent ? \" What if Johnson were to acknowledge the code of silence ? Is Preckwinkle open to keeping him on the job ? \" I 'm always willing to talk to people , \" she said . Also on Friday , Preckwinkle said former President Barack Obama 's steadfast opposition to signing a community benefits agreement to prevent displacement of and guarantee participation by residents of the South Side neighborhoods surrounding the proposed $ 500 million Obama Presidential Center does not prevent the city from cutting such a deal . \" The city could work with community residents around mitigating the impacts that people are fearful of . We can have a community benefits agreement that involves the city and the community . . . . It does n't have to involve the presidential center , \" Preckwinkle said . \" When I was alderman of the 4th Ward , we worked on the Olympic deal because the Olympic Village was gon na be at Michael Reese . So , we worked through a community benefits agreement with residents and we got it passed in the City Council . It does n't have to involve the library . It can involve the city and community residents . \" Johnson reacted angrily to Preckwinkle 's initial promise to fire him , saying he \" came on this job with my integrity and my honor and that 's the way I 'm going to leave this job . \" Without mentioning Preckwinkle by name , Johnson accused the county board president of misconstruing or misinterpreting what he had to say about the code of silence in a deposition . Johnson said then he has led a reform effort that 's unprecedented . \" But the reality is , when you change a culture , you ca n't do that in one or two years . . . ."

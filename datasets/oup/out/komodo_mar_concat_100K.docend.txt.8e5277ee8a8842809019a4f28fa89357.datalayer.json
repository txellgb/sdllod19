    "text": "A couple who found fame by sharing incredible photos of their travels around the world have been criticised for sharing a photo of them hanging out of a train Portuguese bloggers Raquel and Miguel , who blog under the name Explorerssaurus shared two photos from their journey through Sri Lanka . In the photo they are both hanging out the side of the train holding on to the bars . Raquel who is the furthest out of the train , is standing on one leg while Miguel kisses her forehead . The train is travelling over a bridge and appears to be extremely high up over an area of greenery . Many have slammed the couple for posting the \" dangerous \" picture , and others are concerned people may try to copy them . The caption reads : \" We are all on a long journey , with problems to solve , lessons to learn , but most of all , experiences to enjoy . For where are you now and where you will go , for \" I 've always known \" and \" I told you so \" , for \" nothing is happening \" and \" all has gone wrong \" just go out there and do n't wait too long ... \" No matter what happens , make sure you always enjoy this wonderful ride called life When was the last time you went on a trip and where did you go ? \" One angry commenter wrote : \" Such a irresponsible picture !! Shame to see people who will do anything for social media even risk their lives !! \" A fan added : \" Guys think about it ! How many people are going to try this on without safety measures . I do n't think this should be up on social media . No doubt it 's an amazing picture but it 's just does n't deserve to be on social media . \" Another wrote : \" It does n't matter how slow the train was moving ! How do you not understand that ? \" One concerned fan commented : \" Guys that 's so dangerous . Please please be careful . \" But other people loved the photos and defended the couple . One wrote : \" I have to say , as a follower , that this photo has nothing wrong with it . They are not responsible for anyone . If someone else is going to try this \" position \" , it is their responsibility , period . Nothing else encharged on them . \" Another commented : \" Insanse . Beautiful moment . \" One added : \" Amazing picture . \" Mirror Online has contacted the couple for a comment ."

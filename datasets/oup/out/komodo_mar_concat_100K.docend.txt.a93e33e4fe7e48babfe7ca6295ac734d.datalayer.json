    "text": "Irene Kuykendall plays Elizabeth Bennet in Quill Theatre 's \" Pride and Prejudice , \" which runs March 7-24 at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts ' Leslie Cheek Theater . If anyone needed physical evidence of the continuing cultural impact of \" Oride and Prejudice , \" a trip to London 's Hyde Park would certainly clarify things . There , rising from a lake , is a 12-foot-tall fiberglass statue of Colin Firth in a clingy wet shirt , a tribute to the 1995 BBC miniseries adaptation of Jane Austen 's novel . \" Pride and Prejudice \" has seen numerous adaptations on stage and screen . This weekend , Quill Theatre will have its turn bringing to life this love story of manners and expectations during Britain 's Regency era . As in the novel , Christina Calvit 's stage adaptation centers on Elizabeth Bennet , an intelligent , strong-willed 20-year-old with a tendency to judge others from her initial impressions . As she attends balls and her sisters marry , Elizabeth is both repelled and attracted by Mr. Darcy , a wealthy and aloof 28-year-old . \" It is a romantic and compelling love story of two people seemingly not destined to be with each other , \" says director Christopher Owens , adding that the show is relatable to modern audiences in its focus on women and their pushing of societal norms . \" We recognize much of [ Elizabeth 's ] struggle , and we cheer her on . \" He compares Calvit 's adaptation to a radio play : \" The characters basically go between narration and dialogue here , not one narrator who stands on the side and tells you things . \" Like many , Irene Kuykendall first encountered \" Pride and Prejudice , \" as a teenager , setting off on reading frenzy . \" I fell in love with the language , \" says Kuykendall , who stars as Elizabeth . \" That was my first interaction with Jane Austen . I devoured 'Em ma ' and ' Mansfield Park . ' \" One reason Kuykendall says people love \" Pride and Prejudice \" is that the two romantic leads put each other in their places through the course of the story . \" It 's so refreshing to have a nonstereotypical romance , \" Kuykendall says . \" It 's a story about honesty , being honest with ourselves about what our shortcomings and faults are , and building relationships . \" Kuykendall says she 's enjoyed inhabiting such a beloved character . \" Elizabeth is very daring . She 's not apologetic . She does n't apologize for being on a lower social level than some people , \" she says . \" She 's also very playful . She loves to tease , and she loves to get a rise out of people . \" Opposite Kuykendall onstage is real-life boyfriend Axle Burtness , who portrays Mr. Darcy . \" They 've been together a lot , so they bring a personal trust and dynamic \" to the show , Owens says . \" Physically , they 're perfect for this . \" Playing Elizabeth 's mother Mrs. Bennet is Melissa Johnston Price . A comedic role , Mrs. Bennet is preoccupied with marrying her five daughters off to wealthy men , as their family 's land is entailed and none of the women can inherit it . Bennet ] means well , but exhibits some personality traits that would n't be considered proper in high class society , \" Johnston Price says . \" She 's persuasive . She 's kind of brash , but loves her family , loves her daughters , and wants to see the best for them . \" Johnston Price also plays strict and domineering society woman Lady Catherine de Bourgh in the play . \" My characters are the exact opposites of each other , \" says Johnston Price , who will undergo \" lighting fast \" changes of costume and demeanor through the show . \" Lady Catherine is upper crust and knows it and uses [ her power ] . \" Aided by choreographer Jeremy Gershman , Quill 's production will re-create a half-dozen dances of the Regency period ; even the moving of set pieces will be timed to music . \" Dance was a huge social event , normally the only place to interact and meet people during this time frame , but it 's also a metaphor for people trying each other out , \" Owens says . \" It 's going to be a gorgeous show . \" Though filled with humor and wit , Johnston Price says that at heart \" Pride and Prejudice \" is a story concerning Elizabeth Bennet 's development . \" It 's about a young woman coming of age and finding love , \" Johnston Price says . \" Ultimately they end up with each other , and it does n't get any better than that ."

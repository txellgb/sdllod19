    "text": "There is more evidence this morning that both Donald Trump and his son in law Jared Kushner have used their government positions to sell out the United States to foreign dictators in order to make money from shady business deals . \" President Trump early last year directed his then-chief of staff , John F. Kelly , to give presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner a top-secret security clearance -- a move that made Kelly so uncomfortable that he documented the request in writing . \" \" Kelly told colleagues that the decision to give Kushner top-secret clearance was not supported by career intelligence officials . \" \" After Kushner and his wife , Ivanka Trump , pressured the president to grant Kushner the long-delayed clearance , Trump instructed Kelly to fix the problem . \" MSNBC 's Joe Scarborough said this morning that he had warned Kushner after Trump 's election that he could not continue pursuing business opportunities while serving in the White House , but Kushner did n't listen to him . After intelligence officials recommended against granting Kushner access to top-secret classified information , not only did Trump personally intervene to get him the clearance but he also lied about it . This is a really serious process , and the recklessness and the lying by Ivanka and Donald Trump show once again they are just extraordinarily reckless people in charge of some of the most sensitive secrets in the United States government . \" \" His father-in-law 's doing both , \" he added , \" and we 've talked about this a lot over the past two-and-a-half years . What Joe Scarborough has done this morning is make clear that Jared Kushner and Donald Trump have sold out the United States . They are more interested in doing business deals and making money than they are in serving the people of the United States . There is no question that they have crossed both ethical and legal boundaries , as well as violating the oaths of office . It is time for the corrupt administration of Donald Trump to come to an end . Hopefully that will happen before permanent damage is done to the security interests of our country ."

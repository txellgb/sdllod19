    "text": "If the Cardinals are n't taking Kyler Murray with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2019 NFL Draft , then they put up the biggest smokescreen the Combine has ever seen . Between Arizona general manager Steve Keim and the Oklahoma quarterback taking the podium in Indianapolis , there was nothing clandestine about the burgeoning love affair between team and prospect . Keim had us at \" Hello , \" or when he suggested that Josh Rosen , last year 's No. 10 overall pick , was only the team 's QB \" right now . \" Then Murray tipped his hand Friday that the Cards would be among the teams interviewing him , despite them already having a first-round quarterback . COMBINE RESULTS : Highlights from player workouts Murray 's time at the podium talking to media will be his only public moment at the Combine ; he revealed he was saving his workout and athletic drills for his pro day March 13 rather than Sunday . Although there 's a lot he could show football evaluators after choosing to give up his status as an MLB prospect , Murray seemed confident he has already sold a team . Murray went through the drill of being asked about all the potential teams that could draft him in the first round , including the Giants and Redskins . By far his most enthusiastic answer came at the thought of playing in the \" Air Raid \" offense of Cardinals rookie coach Kliff Kingsbury , who recruited him in high school . \" If I were to play under him , I think it 'd be a great deal , \" Murray said . \" Me and him being together , it 'd be nice . \" For college , Murray opted to start at Texas A&M vs. joining Kingsbury 's Texas Tech program . This time , Kingsbury 's team , well , holds all the cards with the decision . MOCK DRAFT : SN has different take on Cards ' pick Rosen had a rough rookie year . The Cardinals blew up everything with the coaching staff and made Steve Wilks a one-and-done . There 's a whole sense of do-over in the organization , including with Keim . Rosen is n't immune , nor should he be . Quite simply , the organization would lose precious competitive time by continuing with a young QB who no longer fits the system and has a lot more developing to do . Arizona is also in a copycat league where the trend of hiring young offensive hotshots to lead teams is followed closely by rolling more with athletic , dynamic quarterbacks . Baker Mayfield , a fellow Heisman Trophy winner and Murray 's predecessor at Oklahoma , ultimately went No. 1 overall to the Browns last year because he had the most \" it \" factor vs. Rosen , Sam Darnold and Josh Allen . And given the immediate raw success Lamar Jackson had as the final pick in the first round , he proved that special continues to find a way to be special , despite what concerns teams might have about \" prototypical \" and \" ideal size . \" The Browns ' love for Mayfield was a well-kept secret until his name was called first in the '18 draft , but Cleveland legitimately had to make a tougher decision as it weighed what Mayfield could do vs. Rosen , Darnold and Allen . The Cardinals ' situation is different . There are just as many questions with Dwayne Haskins , Drew Lock and Daniel Jones , and none of the no-brainer answers that Murray can provide . From Arizona 's perspective , he 's the only choice that represents a clear upgrade over Rosen . MORE : Murray 's height source of Twitter sarcasm There 's obvious chemistry between the Cardinals and Murray , and there 's no surprise the buzz got louder when they shared the same building . Who would help the Cardinals win games faster in a division where the Rams just went to the Super Bowl , the Seahawks returned to the playoffs and the 49ers are on their way back ? Nick Bosa is a ca n't - miss pass-rusher but he ca n't suddenly make Arizona turn the corner and become a contender . There 's also enough trade interest in Rosen from other teams , such as the Giants and Redskins , that would clear the path for the Cardinals to draft Murray and bail themselves out of back-to-back first-round QB contracts . What Mayfield did last year for Cleveland , the weakness of this QB class in relation to the previous one , and Kingsbury installing a Murray-friendly offense all make for a perfect storm . Sometimes , the cards are just too good for someone to force a poker face . Consider the Cardinals and Murray to be all in on each other ."

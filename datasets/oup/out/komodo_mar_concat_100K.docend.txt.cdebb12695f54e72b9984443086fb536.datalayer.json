    "text": "MANILA , Philippines -- The Senate committee on public services approved yesterday proposals to allow motorcycles as modes of public transportation . The panel approved Senate Bills 2173 and 2180 as well as Resolution 993 authored by Senate President Pro-Tempore Ralph Recto and Senators Joseph Victor Ejercito and Grace Poe , respectively . The measures seek to lift the ban on two-wheeled vehicles from transporting passengers . \" We recognize that motorcycle is an alternative mode of transportation , particularly going to the main hubs of transport , \" said Poe , chairperson of the committee , after she adjourned the hearing in Cabanatuan City , Nueva Ejica . The city is considered to be the tricycle capital of the country . Poe said the panel would release a report on the final version of the measure . She vowed to push for its approval before the 17th Congress ends . Poe said there is a strong demand for motorcycles to be made into public utility vehicles . Poe said once the bill becomes a law , this does not give a blanket authorization to motorcycle owners to register to app-based motorcycle services . Ejercito vowed to push for the enactment of the mandatory training for motorcycle owners ."

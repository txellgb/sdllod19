    "text": "The corporate regulator is yet to serve crucial legal documents on the directors of fallen market darling GetSwift , Joel Macdonald and Bane Hunter , for its upcoming court case . Norman O'Bryan SC , the regulator 's barrister , told the Federal Court on Friday morning it does not know whether Mr Macdonald , a former Melbourne AFL player and Young Rich Lister , is living in Australia or overseas , and will need to make a special court application to serve documents on Mr Hunter , who lives in the United States . Following an investigation by The Australian Financial Review in January 2018 , the Australian Securities and Investments Commission launched a court case against GetSwift , Mr Macdonald and Mr Hunter last week , alleging that GetSwift breached the Corporations Act by making a series of misleading announcements on the Australian Securities Exchange relating to clients it had secured between February and December 2017 . ASIC also alleges that Mr Hunter and Mr McDonald were involved in GetSwift 's failure to meet its obligations and failed to discharge their duties as directors with due care and diligence . \" The company , Mr Macdonald and Mr Hunter irrefutably deny the allegations made by ASIC and , collectively , will vigorously defend the proceedings , \" GetSwift wrote in an ASX announcement on Monday ."

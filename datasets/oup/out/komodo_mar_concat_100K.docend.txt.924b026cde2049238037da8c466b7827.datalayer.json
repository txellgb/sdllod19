    "text": "The top-spec rally class in New Zealand and Australian national rallies , AP-4 is a locally-made alternative to R5-spec rally cars . Vehicles made to AP-4 rules are just as quick as European R5 machines , but they avoid the import fees and tariffs associated with bringing a car into Oceania . The AP-4 conversion kit is modular and can be applied to nearly any car , even a mid-sized SUV . Ryan Millen , the ARA 2WD class champion in 2017 , was left out in the cold after Toyota pulled their factory funding at the end of that year . But Millen still had his equipment , so he shipped a spare Rav4 shell to Force Motorsport in New Zealand and had them get to work . The result is an SUV with AWD , a sequential transmission , 300-plus turbocharged horses , and oodles of suspension travel ."

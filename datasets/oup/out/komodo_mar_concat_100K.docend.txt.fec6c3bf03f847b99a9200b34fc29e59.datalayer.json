    "text": "Memphis-based logistics behemoth FedEx unveiled a small , ground-based delivery robot earlier this week , according to The Wall Street Journal . Dubbed FedEx SameDay Bot , the robot is designed to execute same-day deliveries to consumers . FedEx already has signed up a number of large retailers for the trials , which will take place in Memphis , including Lowe 's , Target , Walgreens , and Walmart . FedEx Chief Marketing Officer Brie Carere said eventually retailers could modify the robots to deliver different products , and even brand the bots with their logos . FedEx is eyeing enterprise merchants -- who 'd like to maintain control over the shopping experience -- instead of appealing directly to consumers . Delivery robots are n't a new concept : There are plenty of startups developing them , while companies like crowdsourced delivery startup Postmates as well as Amazon have introduced robots of their own . Most firms developing these bots either own the entire customer journey themselves -- like Postmates and Amazon -- or aim to sell their product to merchants who do . UPS is instead partnering with merchants , and simply executing deliveries as a service the way it always has -- just minus the human . FedEx is the first legacy logistics firm to introduce a delivery robot for the US . Its early entry , combined with its long-standing relationships -- which have already won it high-profile partnerships -- could help the company earn significant business from merchants looking to cut same-day delivery costs . SameDay Bot gives FedEx a way around competing directly with Amazon in the last-mile delivery space . It 's only a matter of time until Amazon is a full-fledged competitor to UPS and FedEx in the last mile delivery space ; it has slowly been delivering more of its own orders , and it recently confirmed that it considers itself a logistics firm . Given its recently introduced robot , Amazon will inevitably be a major player in the last-mile automation space as well . For FedEx , offering SameDay Bot is a way to avoid some head-on competition by going after large retailers like Walmart that want to cut delivery costs but are n't comfortable with working with Amazon , their chief competitor . And , even if FedEx does eventually compete directly with Amazon in another segment of the last-mile automation space -- like drone delivery , for example -- securing retail customers for SameDay Bot will likely facilitate those efforts . If FedEx makes its retail partners happy with SameDay , it will likely have an easier time convincing those customers to test out its eventual drone program as well . 1 .

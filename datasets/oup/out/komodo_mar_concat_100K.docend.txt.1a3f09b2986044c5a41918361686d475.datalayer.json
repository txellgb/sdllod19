    "text": "New Delhi : Pakistan has turned down a request by India to send back Indian Air Force ( IAF ) pilot Abhinandan Varthaman by aerial route and not through the Attari-Wagah land border , official sources said Friday . They said hours after Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan announced the decision to release Mr Varthaman , India conveyed to Islamabad that he be sent back via the aerial route . However , late in the night , Pakistan conveyed to India that the pilot would be returned through the Attari-Wagah border and India 's request could not be heeded to , the sources said . Mr Varthaman was captured by Pakistan after his Mig-21 Bison was shot down by a Pakistani jet during a fierce dogfight on Wednesday . The IAF pilot 's MiG 21 was shot and he bailed out after bringing down one Pakistani F-16 fighter during the dogfight to repel a Pakistani attack early on Wednesday morning . Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated after Indian fighters bombed terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed 's ( JeM ) biggest training camp near Balakot deep inside Pakistan early Tuesday . It came 12 days after the JeM claimed responsibility for a suicide attack on a Central Reserve Police Force ( CRPF ) convoy in Kash-mir 's Pulwama , killing 40 soldiers . The Pakistan Air Force carried out a retaliatory aerial combat , unsuccessfully targeting several Indian military nstallations ."

    "text": "What the Liberty Lancers lacked in tournament experience , they more than made up for in height . The Lancers ' trio of 6-footers combined for 42 points , and sixth-seeded Liberty beat the fifth-seeded Davenport Gorillas , last year 's State 2B runner-up , 55-45 on Thursday afternoon at the Spokane Arena to advance to the semifinals . In Liberty 's first appearance at state in a decade , it has won two consecutive games and will face either top-seeded Wahkiakum or 15th-seeded South Bend at 7:15 p.m. Friday . \" The girls program has n't gone this far in a long time , so it 's very humbling and awesome for us , \" Lancers junior Maisie Burnham said . \" We 've been waiting for this since we were little . It 's our time to shine , and we 're ready . \" Burnham led all scorers with 17 points , including a 9-for-12 day at the free-throw line . Liberty hit 17 of 22 free-throw attempts , Davenport just 9 of 20 . Sophomore Delaney Goodwin and junior Aleena Cook - both listed at 6-foot - added 13 and 12 points , respectively , for Liberty . Cook had 11 rebounds , Burnham 14 . \" We always try to exploit mismatches when we have them , so having 6-footers that can play the game at a high level is definitely a benefit , regardless of who we play , \" Liberty coach Chris Colvin said . Davenport ( 21-5 ) , experienced after a 2017 state championship and last year 's second-place finish , was outrebounded 39-29 and never led . The Gorillas also had four players foul out , including sophomore Janaye Wilkie , who picked up her fifth foul with 2\u00a01/2 minutes left , Burnham driving toward the basket . Wilkie led Davenport with 16 points . The Gorillas trailed 47-40 at the time . Junior Lainy Jacobsen 's basket got them within five points on the next possession , but they never got closer . Davenport coach Stacia Soliday said she did n't think her team 's youth was a factor , except perhaps at the end . \" There was some end-of-the-game management that we 're not experts at because we are young , \" Soliday said . Neither team shot above 30 percent in the first half - Liberty led 22-17 at the break - but both picked up the pace in the second . Liberty ( 22-4 ) pushed its lead to double digits early in the third quarter . Burnham picked up her fourth foul with 1\u00a01/2 minutes left in the quarter , the Lancers ahead 37-28 . She sat the rest of the quarter but played all of the fourth with those four fouls . \" I trust Maisie to go out there and play the game the way that she knows she should be playing and not make silly mistakes , \" Colvin said . Liberty pushed its lead to as many as 12 in the fourth quarter . Sophomores Ellie Telford and Darby Soliday scored 11 apiece for the Gorillas , who will play a loser-out game against at 12:15 p.m. Friday ."

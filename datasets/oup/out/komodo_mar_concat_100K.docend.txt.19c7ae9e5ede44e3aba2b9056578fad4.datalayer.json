    "text": "The main pendulum between market optimism and pessimism continues to be developments in trade negotiations between China and the United States . And this morning it appears to have swung to the bullish side . The hopefulness comes after a Bloomberg report said U.S. officials are working up a final trade deal that the two sides could sign in a matter of weeks . The news appeared to help Asian shares overnight along with news that a global index provider will increase the weighting of mainland China shares it its global benchmarks . Meanwhile , European shares stepped on the gas with help from the auto sector . Back on this side of the pond on Thursday , the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average faltered for the last three sessions of February , but still managed to post gains for the second month in a row . The Nasdaq also closed out the month higher . It 's a stark contrast to the close of last year when stocks were under pressure because of fear the Fed would raise interest rates too much and worries about the U.S.-China trade war . ( See more on the change in market circumstances below . ) While the Fed 's apparent pivot away from interest rate hikes has been a load off for the market . Concerns about the trade war between the world 's two largest economies have continued , with recent optimism fading a bit . On the one hand comments to CNBC from White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin were positive on progress on the talks . And the U.S. is going to take steps to formally abandon plans to increase tariffs on $ 200 billion of Chinese goods to 25 % , from 10 % now , while the two sides continue talking , The Wall Street Journal reported . But a counterpoint to that bullish news flow seemed to be U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer 's comments to Congress that China buying more U.S. goods is n't a strong enough catalyst for a permanent trade deal to end a situation that has been weighing on the market for months . The U.S. government reported stronger-than-expected gross domestic product on Thursday , and the delayed reading on Q4 GDP showing the economy grew 2.6 % during the quarter when many analysts had expected 2 % or even less , probably helped to counter the pressure from unease about the trade situation . The U.S. / North Korea summit ending without a deal amid disagreement on U.S. sanctions also appeared to weigh on the market . Ahead of inflation data out this morning , Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Richard Clarida said the central bank is n't altering its 2 % inflation target . Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Thursday evening that rising productivity means wage growth is n't producing problematic inflation . He reiterated that inflation appears \" muted . \" The comments come ahead of today 's core Personal Consumption Expenditure ( PCE ) data , which is the Fed 's preferred inflation gauge . Core PCE rose a bit more than expected , coming in at 0.2 % for December when a 0.1 % gain had been expected in a Briefing.com In corporate news Gap said the company is heading toward a split into two separate entities , with Old Navy being spun off into its own company . Investors appear to be loving the idea , with GPS shares up around 20 % in pre-market trading . The move may allow the Old Navy brand to flourish on its own and management at the other company to focus on shoring up the Gap brand . Gap also said it would close more than 200 Gap stores in the next two years as part of a restructuring . The news comes as Gap reported earnings that beat estimates but revenue that disappointed . Glance in the Rear View : One thing that can be good to keep in mind about the government 's GDP data is that it 's a lagging indicator , meaning that the numbers that get posted are essentially a look into the rear-view mirror for the economy . Of course , rear-view mirrors are there for a reason , though , and a quick glance can be useful . The stock market is about where it was in mid-October as Q4 was well under way . But conditions seem markedly different . Back then , stocks were on the decline amid fears that the Fed would raise interest rates too much , despite low inflation , and worries about the U.S.-China trade war . While there 's no trade deal yet , there appears to have been progress . But probably the most notable shift has been the Fed 's adoption of a dovish stance . The Fed and Yields : Sometimes , when interest rates at the longer end of the curve are low , it can be an ominous sign about the economy weakening . But at the moment it appears that another force is at work . One result of the Fed 's more dovish policy stance is that it is keeping its balance sheet large , which can help to keep longer-dated interest rates low even if the economy is doing relatively well . On Thursday , the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury rose , moving above the 2.7 % mark , helped by the solid GDP report . Because bond yields move inversely to their prices , rising yields can indicate that investors are selling bonds because they do n't feel the need for as much of the security that low-risk U.S. debt can provide . Change Afoot in EPS Expectations ? Amid the recovery in stocks from the swoon late last year , it seems that investors may be pricing in favorable geopolitical outcomes , which could end up helping to reverse a slide in earnings expectations . \" Since prices frequently lead fundamentals , investors may now be anticipating the avoidance of a prolonged trade war with China and a hard Brexit , \" investment research firm CFRA said in a note Wednesday , saying that \" some believe the outcome of a second Brexit resolution vote could end up calling the whole thing off . \" As of Wednesday , 2019 earnings-per-share ( EPS ) growth estimates showed expectations for a rise of just 2.8 % , down from 6.5 % year-to-date , according to CFRA . But a change could be on the horizon . \" With the S&P 500 's multiple now slightly ahead of its long-term average , increased EPS growth expectations will likely be the catalyst needed to propel share prices further , \" CFRA said ."

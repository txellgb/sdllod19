    "text": "Earlier in the week , prospects traveled to Indianapolis to take part in the NFL combine . As you know , this is a job fair for many hopeful players . And for some , their NFL dreams hang in the balance . Now that measurements and weigh-ins have concluded , players will take the field to showcase their skills in a number of drills starting Friday . And while NFL hopefuls are taking the field , GMs and agents begin to turn their attention to the off-season , more specifically free agency . Yes , the Dolphins are not believed to be major players And yes , we all know the rumors about 2019 being nothing more than a red-shirt season for the new regime . But if Brian Flores and Co. do plan to be competitive this season , they will almost certainly look towards free agency to fill a few of the teams voids . One of the biggest needs on the Dolphin 's roster , is on the defensive line , primarily at the defensive end position . Enter Trey Flowers . According to Tony Pauline of DraftAnalyst.com , the Dolphins are currently the front runner for the 25-year old pass rusher . The word in Indianapolis is that the Miami Dolphins are the front runners for top-rated pass rusher Trey Flowers at this point . The former fourth-round pick is generally considered the top available player in this year 's free-agent market . Whether or not Miami actually signs Flower is to be determined . Many believe he is the best player on the open market , and could command a 5 year , $ 75-million contract . Which would be a lot of money , for a team not expected to compete until 2021 and beyond . However , Flowers has familiarity with Coach Flores and proved throughout his career he can be a versatile piece in a multiple front defense . In 2018 , Flowers combined for 57 tackles and 7.5 sacks . Over the span of his four-year career , Flowers has amassed 157 total tackles and 21 sacks . He would be a welcomed addition to a defense that struggled to get any pressure on the quarterback last season ."

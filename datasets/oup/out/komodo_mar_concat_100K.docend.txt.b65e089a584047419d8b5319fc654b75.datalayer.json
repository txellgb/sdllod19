    "text": "House Democrats ' new single-payer bill would legally prohibit today 's private health insurance and determine financing for doctors and hospitals . ARON P. BERNSTEIN/REUTERS/NewscomA decade ago , as the legislation that would become Obamacare was making its way through Congress , Republicans frequently blasted the Democrats ' health plan as a \" government takeover of health care . \" That phrase , introduced into circulation by GOP messaging guru Frank Luntz , was eventually awarded Politifact 's Lie of the Year . One could argue about whether the GOP 's attack was the most significant lie of 2010 , but it was , at minimum , an exaggeration . Although the Affordable Care Act increased regulation on individual health insurance to the point where it became something resembling a public utility , it left the bulk of the market for private health coverage intact , and even provided subsidies so that people could obtain ( heavily regulated ) private coverage . Today , an estimated 177 million Americans have private coverage . The single-payer health care plans now being put forth by Democrats under the label \" Medicare for All , \" however , would eliminate that coverage . As Rep. Pramila Jayapal ( D-Wash . ) said this week when announcing House Democrats ' new Medicare for All bill , the plan would \" mean a system where there are no private insurance companies that provide these core comprehensive benefits that will be covered through the government . \" Unlike Obamacare , then , Medicare for All can legitimately be described as a government takeover of health care . Although Jayapal 's plan would allow for the creation of a secondary market for supplementary coverage in addition to the government-run plan and direct cash payments to doctors , the market for the private health coverage that tens of millions of Americans currently have would be eliminated . Employers and insurers would be prohibited by law from providing the same benefits as the the government plan , a prohibition that goes further than some other countries with national health care systems . Private insurance as we know it today would be illegal . And while the federal government would neither own hospitals nor employ doctors directly , it would be in charge of the vast majority of the nation 's health care financing . That would include setting a \" national health budget \" -- essentially , a federally imposed cap on total health care spending -- and divvying up those funds by region . The federal government would also determine the budgets for capital improvements at medical facilities and set up a fee schedule imposing rates paid to doctors in private . In addition , the government would also specify staffing levels for physicians , and determine the preferred ratio of nurses to patients at any given facility . It 's true that the government already sets rates for Medicare in its current form , and those rates exert a significant influence on the administration of health care throughout the country . But today 's Medicare exists alongside multiple private payers that would be eliminated under single-payer , leaving the government as the sole payer for most services . So while doctors and hospitals would not technically be state owned under Medicare for All , the federal government would determine how the vast majority of the nation 's health care dollars would be spent , making providers even more reliant on federal funds -- and more susceptible to the influence and incentives of federal payment schemes -- than they are today . Some practitioners might avoid this by accepting only cash payments , but it 's reasonable to assume most would not . As a consequence , doctors and others in the health industry would become de facto federal employees , with significant staffing and payment decisions made by the federal government , according to formulas set by federal agencies . Medicare for All , as envisioned by single-payer proponents like Jayapal and Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I-Vt . ) , would thus bring about an explicit nationalization of health care financing and a tacit nationalization of health care delivery . This is not an incidental byproduct of single-payer health care , but the defining feature : Medicare for All is designed to give politicians and federal bureaucrats dramatically increased control over the nation 's health care system . Republicans were mistaken to dub Obamacare a government takeover , but when it comes to single-payer , the description applies : Putting the federal government in charge is the heart of the plan ."

    "text": "Valentine 's Day may have come and gone , hearts broken and healed , but that does n't mean there is ever a bad time for a good love song . In fact , Chicago musician and producer , Shubu , has not just one , but TWO , new singles that will pair perfectly with that leftover box of chocolates you just found under a pile of magazines . A frequent collaborator of Dorian Electra , Mood Killer , and Paul Cherry , Shubu follows up their debut single \" Acid Rain \" with the release of their two sparkling new tracks \" Heart of Love \" and \" All I Need Is Your Tender Love & Kisses in the Pouring Rain . \" Essentially offering both sides of the same coin , Shubu explores a full range of love-tangled emotions on the new songs covering everything from soaring infatuation to sensual yearning ."

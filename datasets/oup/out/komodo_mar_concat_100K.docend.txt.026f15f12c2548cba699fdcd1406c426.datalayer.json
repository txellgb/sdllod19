    "text": "Cam McCarthy 's hopes of earning selection in round one have taken a major hit , after the mobile forward was left out of Fremantle 's 26-man squad to face Collingwood in Joondalup on Monday . McCarthy - whose lucrative three-year contract expires at season 's end - was vying for a place in the Dockers ' new-look forward-line , alongside boom recruits Jesse Hogan and Rory Lobb . But Fremantle has instead chosen Matthew Taberner to be its third key target , while tall utility Brennan Cox will also feature in the pre-season hit-out at Arena Joondalup ."

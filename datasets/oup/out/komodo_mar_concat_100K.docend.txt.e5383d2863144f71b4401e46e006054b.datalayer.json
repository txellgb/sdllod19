    "text": "Electronic cigarettes are marketed as less harmful alternatives to cigarette smoking , but researchers are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term health consequences of vaping . A study released Thursday in the journal Tobacco Control adds to the growing number of reasons that the phenomenon is more risky than it might appear . According to scientists from the University of Rochester and the Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center , people who vape are nearly twice as likely to experience wheezing compared to people who do n't regularly use tobacco products . Wheezing -- which is typically caused by inflammation and narrowing of the airway between the throat and lungs -- is often seen as a precursor to serious health conditions , including lung cancer and heart failure . \" The take-home message is that electronic cigarettes are not safe when it comes to lung health , \" study author Deborah Ossip , Ph.D. , announced Thursday . Importantly , this study does n't prove that vaping causes wheezing . Instead , it identifies an association between the two . This association has been found in previous studies as well , including a 2017 paper in PLOS One that found a link between e-cigarette use and greater odds of wheezing and shortness of breath . Here the researchers analyzed self-reported data collected from 28,000 Americans who participated in the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health ( PATH ) study . The study participants including current vapers who used e-cigarettes exclusively , people who only smoked traditional cigarettes , dual users , and non-users who avoided tobacco products . When they compared non-users to those who exclusively vape , they found that the risk of wheezing and related respiratory symptoms significantly increased : Adult vapers were 1.7 times more likely to experience difficulty breathing . Meanwhile , vapers had lower odds of wheezing compared to those who only smoked cigarettes and those who used both tobacco products . \" Promoting complete cessation of both smoking and vaping will be beneficial to maximize the risk reduction of wheezing and other related respiratory symptoms , \" the study authors recommend . \" Importantly , we reported that ex-smokers who did not vape , although they had already quit smoking , still have significantly elevated risk of wheezing and other related respiratory symptoms , compared with never smokers , suggesting long-term impact of prior smoking . \" The authors note that these results are particularly concerning because of the mass use of e-cigarettes by both adults and juveniles alike . They write that statistics indicate that close to 13 percent of American adults have tried vaping , and four percent currently do so . Meanwhile , Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data show that in 2018 vaping increased by 78 percent among 9th to 12th graders and 48 percent in 6th to 8th graders . In 2017 , more than 2 million middle and high school students were regular users of e-cigarettes . It 's a rise that caused Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb , M.D. , to announce in September that the use of e-cigarettes by teenagers has now reached \" nothing short of an epidemic proportion of growth . \" According to Gottlieb , the \" FDA wo n't tolerate a whole generation of young people becoming addicted to nicotine , \" and is putting pressure on e-cigarette makers to cease marketing to teenagers . In turn , the scientists behind this study are concerned that their research indicates that if young people continue to vape , they will develop serious health consequences . Vaping might be healthier than smoking cigarettes , but that does n't mean the act itself is healthy ."

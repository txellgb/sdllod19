    "text": "The BC Utilities Commission ( BCUC ) approved the companies request to return to a single , flat rate for its residential electricity customers over a period of five years . In a media release Thursday , FortisBC said the BC Utilities Commission ( BCUC ) approved the companies request to return to a single , flat rate for its residential electricity customers over a period of five years . The release said the request formed part of FortisBC 's Cost of Service Analysis and Rate Design Application , submitted to the BCUC in December 2017 . \" We 're satisfied with this result , \" said Diane Roy , vice-president of regulatory affairs , FortisBC in the media release . \" During the rate design process , we heard from many residential customers with concerns about the two-tiered rate , particularly those with high energy needs and limited conservation options . A gradual return to a flat rate balances the interests of our residential customers . \" FortisBC said the two-tiered rate , also known as the residential conservation rate ( RCR ) , was put in place in 2012 at the direction of the BCUC to encourage energy conservation . Customers pay a higher rate when their use exceeds 1,600 kilowatt hours ( kWh ) over a two-month period . The company said returning to a flat rate provides annual savings for about 30 per cent of customers who had higher bills under the two-tiered system . It could also mean moderate bill increases for lower use customers who saved under the two-tiered system . The phased approach reduces the bill impacts for these customers , which FortisBC forecasts to be less than 3.5 per cent per year . The actual change to individual accounts will vary , depending on use . Returning to a flat rate is revenue-neutral for FortisBC . \" Helping customers reduce their bills remains a priority for FortisBC , \" said Roy . \" We continue to enhance our energy saving programs , especially those that support customers on the tightest budgets , and we encourage all customers to contact us if they need help . \" As a regulated utility , FortisBC requires approval for rate design changes like this through a rigorous and transparent process with the BCUC . This involves a comprehensive look at the cost of providing service to each rate class and a review of several options for rate design . Through this process , FortisBC solicited input from a variety of stakeholders , hosted eight public consultation sessions and responded to approximately 1,800 information requests from 13 interveners . \" We would like to thank the many people who took part in the engagement process , \" said Roy , \" We believe this level of participation results in the best outcomes for our customers and we appreciate everyone who contributed to this effort . \" While the BCUC approved a phased-in return to a flat residential rate and changes to FortisBC 's other rate classes , it rejected a new optional time-of-use rate for residential customers . FortisBC is continuing to review the decision and once complete , will establish a timeline for implementing the approved rate design changes .

    "text": "A defender has n't won the PFA Players ' Player of the Year award since John Terry in 2004/05 . It was 1988/89 when Steve Nicol became the last defender to win the FWA Footballer of the Year prize , and 10 years ago when Nemanja Vidic picked up Premier League Player of the Season . \" If the season ended tonight , I would give him it personally , \" Robertson said of Van Dijk 's chances , as quoted by the Daily Mail . It will be close if he does n't win it . \" Liverpool spent a world record \u00a3 75m to buy Van Dijk from Southampton halfway through last season . The fee raised eyebrows at the time , but Liverpool appear to be getting their money 's worth given the way the Dutchman has dramatically improved a previously suspect defence . When somebody is running at you and you know Virgil is inside - he 's rarely out of position , if ever , \" Robertson continued . Van Dijk won Premier League Player of the Month for December earlier this season , becoming the first defender to win the monthly accolade since Jan Vertonghen in March 2013 ."

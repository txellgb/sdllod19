    "text": "The crime rate for one of Florida 's safest cities may have dipped last year , but violent crimes increased . The FBI 's latest semi-annual Uniform Crime Report shows that violent crimes increased in Cape Coral for the first half of 2018 compared to the first half of 2017 . The increase was due to robberies , which more than doubled in that time from 12 in the first half of 2017 to 28 in the first half of 2018 , the report shows . All other violent crimes decreased during that time . Previous coverage : Florida crime drops in first half of 2018 , down 4 percent in Lee County Robberies are nearly impossible to prevent , because they can be as simple as people snatching purses on the street , according to Master Sgt. Alan Kolak , spokesman for the Cape Coral Police Department . In fact , the majority of the robberies were \" person on person , \" he said . Most of them seemed to be drug related or drug deals gone wrong , he said . And most were \" NFA 'd \" at the time of the report , which means the victim preferred to have \" No Further Action \" in the case , he said . The next highest category was home invasions -- there were seven for the time period , he said . At least two of those were drug related . The city , which often makes the \" safest cities \" lists put out by various organizations , has been proactive with its crime prevention efforts . For example , partnering with Ring , a home security technology business that incorporates outdoor motion-based cameras and doorbells into homes , has helped the department reduce the number of home burglaries . \" One big aspect that we have in our agency is that we have a huge partnership with our community , \" he said . \" We partnered with Ring which has assisted both in deterring crime and also catching offenders . \" Property crimes dropped from 1,488 in the first half of 2017 to 1,369 in the first half of 2018 . Burglaries saw the biggest decline , from 290 in the first half of 2017 to 202 in the first half of 2018 . Motor vehicle thefts increased from 72 in the first half of 2017 to 83 in the first half of 2018 . Scott Melick , who owns Scotty 's Bierwerks at 901 East Industrial Circle in Cape Coral , said he feels \" fairly safe \" as a business owner in the city . \" I feel Cape Coral is safe , \" he said . \" You do see some car break-ins , but I think a lot of that is just opportunity because people are leaving their cars unlocked . \" As a business owner , he said he does worry about break-ins . But in the two years since the brewery opened its doors , that has n't happened . The business sits at the end of a building and is well-lit , he said . \" There are some parts of Lee County I would n't want to be in , \" he said . \" I think it 's fairly safe here as far as anywhere else in the Cape , like some of the industrial parts of Cape Coral . \" More : Florida crime drops in first half of 2018 , down 6 percent in Collier County , report says"

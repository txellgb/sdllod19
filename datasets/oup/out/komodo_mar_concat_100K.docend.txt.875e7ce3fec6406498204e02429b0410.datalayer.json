    "text": "In case you have missed it , organ donation laws in England are changing . From spring 2020 , the processes for organ donation will change , in line with laws already in place in Wales . To help you understand the changes and what they might mean for you , Future London has taken a closer look at what the current laws are and what will happen when they change . At the moment , organ donation in England follows the ' opt in ' rule . This means that anyone who wants to donate organs after they die must sign up as a donor on the NHS Organ Donor Register . According to the NHS , there is an \" urgent \" need for more donors to sign up as about three people in need of an organ die every day in the UK . If someone has died and not registered as an organ donor , nurses will speak to the person 's family to discuss whether or not they will allow their relative 's organs to be used . In 2020 , the system will change to ' opt out ' or ' deemed consent ' . This means that every patient who dies is considered a potential organ donor if they are eligible . Those who do not wish to donate their organs after they die must put their details on the NHS Organ Donor Register to say they do not want to participate , or that they are in one of the excluded groups . You can also nominate up to two people to help make the decision about what happens to your organs after you die - for example a family member or a religious leader . In Wales , the organ donation law is ' opt out ' or ' deemed consent ' . This legislation was introduced in December 2015 . In Scotland and Northern Ireland , the rules are ' opt in ' for both organ and tissue donation . However , a version of an ' opt out ' system is set to be introduced in Scotland within the next few years , after the Scottish Parliament almost unanimously voted in favour of it . In 2016 , the Northern Ireland Assembly decided to keep organ donation laws as they are after deliberation on whether or not they should change ."

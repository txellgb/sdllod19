    "text": "Perhaps the factor most responsible for perpetuating the problem of slow play on the PGA Tour ( and golf in general ) is that no one ever admits to playing slow . In a recent anonymous survey of tour pros by Golf Magazine , 100 percent of responders said they play at an acceptable pace . And if you took a poll of your weekend playing partners , odds are you 'd get the same ridiculous results . So it 's no surprise when PGA Tour pros are told they 're playing too slowly , they 're usually not thrilled . And Charl Schwartzel became the latest example of that during Thursday 's first round of the Honda Classic . After the 2011 Masters champ 's group was put on the clock on the 18th hole , the usually cool-headed South African got \" heated \" as described by NBC/Golf Channel 's Dan Hicks during Friday 's coverage . RELATED : Can this T-shirt solve the slow play crisis ? \" We 're showing you Charl Schwartzel having a heated discussion with PGA Tour official Andrew Miller , \" Hicks said . \" And normally , Schwartzel is a , you know , very mild mannered , quiet kind of guy , but he was heated up . This was after he completed his 18th hole and was done . \" Here 's a look at the confrontation , which included Schwartzel angrily pointing at Miller : However , it 's possible Schwartzel was n't part of the slow play problem -- especially when you consider one of his playing partners was the infamously deliberate Ben Crane . A man whose snail-like pace once prompted another playing partner , Rory Sabbatini , to leave him in the dust during the 2005 Booz-Allen Classic . In another screenshot , Schwartzel appears to be pointing at someone else . . . In any event , neither Schwartzel , Crane or the third member of the group , Anirban Lahiri , received a penalty because the PGA Tour has n't handed out a penalty for slow play in a non-team event since 1995 . But maybe , just maybe , the tour is getting closer to doing that . And when it does , the player reaction might make this one look tame by comparison ."

    "text": "Severe but not fatal -- that 's the prognosis for the professional and political future of Donald Trump acolyte and Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz after he verbally attacked government witness Michael Cohen on Tuesday . That was one day before Cohen gave damning testimony before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee that depicted the president as a racist , con man. , and law breaker . Due to the timing of the tweet , Gaetz was accused by many politicians and social media lions of engaging in witness tampering . Here is Gaetz ' Twitter attack that mainstream media almost universally refers to as a \" smear \" : Hey @MichaelCohen212 , \" Gaetz tweeted , tagging Cohen 's Twitter handle . Gaetz removed the Tweet hours after posting it and apologized on Twitter for having written it , saying that while he wanted to \" create context around the testimony of liars like Michael Cohen , \" it \" was NOT my intent to threaten as some believe I did . \" \" I should have chosen words that better showed my intent . That relatively quick backtrack probably saved Gaetz major professional problems , but the political fallout will be longlasting , according to seasoned observers . The Florida Bar immediately opened an investigation of Gaetz . On Thursday , the Democratic Coalition , a political action committee , said it had filed a complaint against Gaetz with the Office of Congressional Ethics alleging the congressman 's tweet violated federal criminal law , the House Code of Official Conduct , and House rules.Thanks Naturally , social media also chimed in . The following post and other similar ones have gone viral : \" Matt Gaetz is a licensed attorney in Florida . His Bar Number is 48962 . He violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512 . He could be charged with a felony for witness tampering but this is also grounds for disbarment . Feel free to call the Florida Bar and file an official complaint . The number is 1-866-352-0707 . Please copy and repost . \" Despite the uproar , mostly friom the left , two legal experts interviewed by Tampa Bay Beat firmly believe a Gaetz disbarment is a wild long shot . A prominent Tampa Bay attorney asserted that Gaetz ' expeditious apology mitigated what could have become a far worse professional outcome for the Panhandle congressman . \" Gaetz ' Tweet can easily be construed as a threat to a witness , something the Florida Bar takes extremely seriously , \" the attorney said . \" Even so , I would be surprised if punishment goes beyond a severe reprimand . \" Someone familiar with Florida Bar practices said its Lawyer Regulation Department has wide latitude in deciding whether to aggressively pursue an investigation of Gaetz . Discipline imposed , if any , would ultimately be up to the Florida Supreme Court . \" My gut feeling is that it wo n't go very far and that even if there is ultimately some sort of sanction , it would be light , \" the source suggested . \" Additionally , the U.S. House could refer the matter to its Ethics Committee . \" Both sources said a Gaetz disbarment is difficult to imagine . Politically , Gaetz ' future is far more cloudy . Yes , his district constituents could continually re-elect him but his stock has already fallen from rising star to shooting star . Once mentioned as having the inside track on a high-profile job within the Trump administration , a Gaetz appointment now carries baggage of Pullmanesque proportions . The two-term congressman represents a deep red district in Florida 's Panhandle . He won with 69 percent of the vote in 2016 and 67 percent in 2018 ."

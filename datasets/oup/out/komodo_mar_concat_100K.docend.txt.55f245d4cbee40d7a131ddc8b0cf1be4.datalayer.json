    "text": "Chuka Umanna 's former policy advisor on what the new group should do next . Brexit brought parliament 's rebels together , but it will take policies beyond Brexit to sustain them . So far , the policy statement of the Independent Group reads like the red lines of the British electorate . Over many electoral cycles the revealed preference of the British people is for parties firm on national security , responsible on the public finances , sensible on the economy , and favouring equality of opportunity . Being on the right side of these red lines is a promising place to start . But going beyond a loose grouping to become a real party people can vote for means colouring between those lines , creating a compelling vision of the future , rooted in the real experiences of people 's lives . There are good reasons why some of the group were formerly Conservative MPs and others were Labour . But it could also be an opportunity : to draw from left and right to solve the problems of everyday life . Rather than an amalgam of lowest common denominators , it is the chance to draw from the distinctive best of each tradition . Not bland centrism , but a radical programme to improve the lives of people in every corner of the country , at every stage of life . Such an approach could , for example , combine the right 's focus on responsibility with the left 's understanding of the structural causes of disadvantage and the positive support people need to realise their potential . Both traditions could be mined for ideas to ensure that childhood is valued , work is meaningful , and retirement is secure , across every part of our nation . From childcare to higher education to pensions to social care , the question is increasingly becoming how we share risks that fall unevenly , and how we encourage investments in ourselves that also have wider social benefits . Automatic pension contributions and student loan repayments are now a third line on many people 's pay slips , between take home pay and taxes . Instead of viewing these policies in isolation , an approach that draws from left and right could bring these disparate parts together in a cohesive whole , and extended to new areas of policy . These payments are not tax , but neither are they income : they are something in between , combining individual contribution and personal choice with government support . They strike a balance between individual and shared responsibility , while respecting the different choices people make . This is not big government , but the state enabling people to lead a bigger life . On the economy , it means combining the right 's faith in business and entrepreneurship with the left 's concern for fairness and security , reshaping historic divisions between capital and labour into more collaborative , productive relationships . This is possible with three shifts : a fairer sharing of decision-making power within firms , as is common in countries like Germany ; a more active role for the state in managing the risks for workers of structural change , as in Denmark ; and fairer burden-sharing in gig economy jobs , not just between employers and workers , but also with consumers . Drawing from left and right would mean supporting cooperation between businesses to coexist with competition , a formula lying at the heart of successful clusters around the world . Approaches to ownership have been a traditional dividing line between the collectivist commitments of the left and the individualism of the right . If capital is outflanking labour , as economist Thomas Piketty argues , and robots really are coming for our jobs , then the answer must be in ensuring more private sector capital is in the hands of ordinary people . Drawing from left and right would mean developing new mechanisms for collective investment , held equally so that all share in both downside risks and upside gains and , in time , reducing inequality . In public services , combining left and right means integrated services built around the needs of citizens , putting people in control of their own lives . For the left this means accepting reform ; for the right it offers better outcomes at lower cost . The citizen , both as taxpayer and as service user , is the winner . It could mean taking a life-cycle view of public spending . This would seek to correct the imbalance across the generations highlighted by former Conservative minister David Willetts , perhaps with an unambiguous commitment to investment in the early years and access to lifelong learning . Finally , approach . If Brexit was the cause of the group 's mutual attraction to each other , it was the increasingly toxic nature of their old relationships that made it so much easier to move on . The Independent Group are onto something important in championing a kinder sort of political discourse . But kindness is not just absent from our politics . It is absent from our approach to policy , from welfare to criminal justice to immigration . Kindness might seem a nebulous concept for an approach to policy , but it was been recently championed by New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern in her speech to the UN , and by former Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust chief Julia Unwin , who has considered its application to policy . Beyond Brexit , Britain is crying out for change , for new ideas to address the deep inequalities and divisions that scar our land and pollute our discourse . Combining the best of left and right can help reframe the problems we face , and open up new directions for solutions . In doing so , we can start once more to make Britain a better place to live and work , to grow up and grow old ."

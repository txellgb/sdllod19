    "text": "A 48-year-old man was stabbed and critically wounded Friday in Pasadena and the search for the suspect prompted the lockdown of a junior high school and an order for area residents to shelter in place . The victim , whose name was withheld , was stabbed about 9:05 a.m. in front of an apartment building in the 100 block of South Euclid Avenue , according to Pasadena Police Department spokeswoman Lisa Derderian . Paramedics took him to a hospital , where he was in critical condition , she said . The man lives in and manages the apartment building , according to media reports , but it was unclear if the suspect had any connection to the building or the victim . Officers set up a perimeter containment to search for the suspect , who fled on foot , Derderian said . The block-by-block search , involving helicopters and K-9 units , was in an area bounded by Green Street and California Boulevard , from Los Robles Avenue to Marengo Avenue , she said . Mayfield Junior High School at 405 S. Euclid Ave. was locked down and area residents were told to shelter in place while police searched for the suspect . The lockdown and shelter-in-place orders were lifted about 2:30 p.m. , but residents were urged to report anything suspicious as the suspect remained at large , Derderian said . The suspect was described as black , in his 50s , 5 feet 10 inches to 6 feet tall and balding on the top of his head , Derderian said ."

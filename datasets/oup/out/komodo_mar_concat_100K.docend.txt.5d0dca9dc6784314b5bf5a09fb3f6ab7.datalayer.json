    "text": "A strategic and knowledgeable approach to securing land entitlements streamlines the involved processes and augments returns-on-investment in commercial real estate development . Land entitlements are the cornerstone of land development . Yet , a deep well of patience is necessary to unravel the bureaucratic complexities and multifarious requirements . George Garcia , the Founder and President of real estate development and redevelopment services company G.C. Garcia , Inc. located in Las Vegas , guides real estate investors , site owners and developers as they navigate such enterprises . For this expertise , Garcia and his team have earned the moniker , \" Red Tape Sherpas . \" \" Cutting through the red tape involved in land development , zoning and entitlements is nothing short of a complex series of carefully managed activities , \" says Garcia . Garcia has nearly 30 years in government planning , land planning and real estate development . Prior to founding his company , he served as Planning Director for the City of Henderson , Nev. and Assistant Planning Director in Overland Park , Kan . In Garcia 's leadership role at G.C. Garcia , Inc. , he guides developers through the process of dealing with local governments , planning boards and other public entities . Before the first shovel breaks ground , he and his team strive to bring clarity to any land planning or zoning situation . For land owners and those seeking new property for future building and development , detailed research is a fundamental precursor in evaluating a project 's potential . A vetting and planning process is essential . From site evaluation to coordinating with government entities , leaving no stone unturned is paramount for real estate entrepreneurs . The procedures give a whole new meaning to doing one 's homework . Garcia advises that a systematic approach to site exploration and procedural planning are prerequisites for real estate investments . \" Government and neighborhood relations , entitlements , due diligence , development coordination , permitting , and business licensing are key elements , \" he says . Coordination will be needed with local and state governments , utility companies , neighbors , and engineers . In many cases , technical studies , redevelopment financial reviews and application submittals are necessary . Common Land Entitlements Formulating project parameters is the first step . You 'll want to understand the five common land entitlements , which are legal agreements between you and government municipalities that allow for land developments . 1 . Amending . The highest level of entitlement requires amending the city 's comprehensive plan , which is the policy that guides city development . \" Amending is the most legally and politically difficult of entitlements , \" Garcia says . \" It 's necessary if you want to change the current use-plans for a piece of land . \" For example , a developer might want to develop land for commercial , industrial or multi-family use , but the city 's plan has slated the property for residential-use at a certain developmental density . To achieve his goal , the developer would have to amend the city 's plan . 2 . Rezoning . If the land is not zoned for your intended use , there is no escaping the rezoning process . \" This can be complicated , \" Garcia says . \" Sometimes , rezoning is not possible , but it can be achieved in most cases with proper management and an action plan . \" Zoning or entitlement of land varies depending upon location . For example , a field on the edge of development is handled differently than an infill property with surrounding development . 3 . Zoning variances . For projects that do n't fit the city 's requirements for size , scale , height , or mass of building , you will need a variance to deviate from the standards . \" There are techniques provided within zoning code , affording the ability to seek waivers and modifications to the standards , \" Garcia says . \" The most restrictive is a variance . \" A well-structured plan , under statues and codes , is the foundation for seeking to vary from the standard requirements . 4 . Permits . A special-use permit needs a discretionary review and approval of the government staff and neighbors to evaluate characteristics of a project . Such factors might include traffic impact , the project 's functionality , or aesthetic implications . A conditional-use permit is one that can be categorized , administratively , in a checkbox fashion . Whether a permit is special-use or conditional-use , can vary depending on the district . 5 . Utility and road approvals . Utilities may not be at your site or be appropriate for your usage . Adequate roadways may not exist to connect your property . For these challenges , you 'll have to attempt to amend the city 's plan to facilitate utilities or create roadways . If you obtain these changes , the higher intensity of zoning will allow you to proceed . With an understanding of the types of entitlements that could be required , the next phase of land development or redevelopment involves due diligence to gain indispensable , preliminary insight that could make or break the ability to seek and secure any necessary entitlements ."

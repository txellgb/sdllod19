    "text": "Coimbatore : Kovai Medical Center and Hospital ( KMCH ) has extracted a lead wire of pacemaker that was implanted in a 50-year-old woman without opening the heart . The procedure that was considered risky , was done for the first time in the district , the hospital said . \" The patient , who had implanted pacemaker device for sick sinus syndrome over two years ago , was admitted to the hospital after she was diagnosed with infection . While the battery of the pacemaker was changed at another hospital , she had approached the hospital to remove the lead wire attached to the heart , \" said Dr Lawrance Jesuraj , electrophysiologist and interventional cardiologist , who performed the extraction . The wire delivers energy from pacemaker to the heart muscle . As years pass , it becomes difficult to separate the wire from the heart , the doctor said , explaining that there are chances of perforating the heart while removing the wire . \" It would result in major bleeding . In some cases , it requires blood transfusion or immediate open heart surgery to save the patient . As manual extraction was not possible , we removed the lead using lead locking device within 45 minutes . It was done under local anaesthesia and conscious sedation in the presence of heart surgeon , \" Jesuraj explained . \" As per the international standard , only 1-2 % of infection is allowed during pacemaker surgeries . But there are instances of 7 % infection . As they are life-threatening , infections need to be cured immediately by removing the lead . The number of such instances are increasing in the country off late . The country hardly has 10 hospitals that performs lead extraction , \" he added ."

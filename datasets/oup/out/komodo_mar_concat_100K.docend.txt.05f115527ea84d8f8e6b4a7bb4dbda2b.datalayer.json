    "text": "The father of climber Tom Ballard , who went missing in the Himalayas five days ago , has said his son 's disappearance is bringing back painful memories of his wife 's death on K2 in 1995 . Helicopters have been scouring Pakistan 's perilous Nanga Parbat for Tom , 30 , and his Italian climbing partner Daniele Nardi , 42 , who have not been heard from since Sunday . Tom 's father Jim Ballard said today that he still holds out hope that his son will return home , even though finding him will be \" like finding a green beer mat on the pitch at Twickenham \" . His wife , Alison Hargreaves , was the first woman to reach the top of Everest unaided . She died in 1995 aged just 33 during a descent from the peak of K2 in the Himalayas and her body has never been found . \" This takes me back to those days , \" Mr Ballard told The Times . \" When the news broke there was no helicopter and we could n't get one to the base camp at K2 . But the same day the Pakistani military became interested and said they could do send one and did . \" On Thursday \" traces of an avalanche \" and a \" tent invaded by snow \" were spotted by search teams doing a sweep of the mountain in a helicopter . It has not been confirmed that the tent belongs to Tom and Daniele . In 2015 , Tom became the first person to ever complete a solo climb of all six major north faces of the Alps in one winter . He has previously said that he is \" following in the family footsteps \" by attempting many of the climbs his mother had completed before her death and that mountaineering is \" in his DNA \" . Ian Sykes , a friend of the Ballard family , told BBC Scotland that Tom was a talented and experienced climber , adding : \" It must have been very tough for the kids growing up without their mum and I hope to God things are going to be ok in this case ."

    "text": "( Reuters ) -- Tobias Harris scored 32 points , and Ben Simmons had a triple-double as the visiting Philadelphia 76ers beat the Oklahoma City Thunder 108-104 on Thursday night . JJ Redick hit two free throws with less than two seconds remaining to put the game away and give the 76ers their fourth win in the past five games . But then Harris took over , as the forward acquired in a trade in early February produced eight consecutive points . The 76ers were without center Joel Embiid for the fourth consecutive game due to left knee tendinitis . Before the game , Philadelphia head coach Brett Brown said it was \" completely up in the air \" whether Embiid would play Saturday against the visiting Golden State Warriors . The Thunder missed forward Paul George , who sat out because of right shoulder soreness ."

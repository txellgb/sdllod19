    "text": "I love a good eye cream . There 's a strange sense of peace that comes over me when I tap a hydrating formula into my often-irritated orbital bone . And that feeling is intensified when I know I 'm nourishing my skin with powerful ingredients . Because this is the way life goes , retinol is both absolutely essential for an effective anti-aging routine and often too harsh for the quick-to-wrinkle eye area . Luckily , there are a number of eye creams that have retinol in them that also use hydrating and soothing ingredients to mitigate the potential for irritation . When shopping for a retinol eye cream , I recommend scanning the ingredients ' list for mega-moisturizers like hyaluronic acid and ceramides . In addition to the fine line-minimizing effects of retinol , hydration may make your skin look younger and glowier ."

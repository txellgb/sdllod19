    "text": "Twin streams , of words and images , drawings and colouring , converge into a seamless whole The title , Doab Dil , is supposed to signify the heart of the convergence of twin streams : words and images , fiction and non-fiction , and so on . Sarnath Banerjee brings together an assortment of real people from around the world and gives us sneak peaks into their lives . Highlighting their quirks and imagining the reasons behind their idiosyncrasies , Doab Dil treads the fine line between fiction and non-fiction . So there is Charles Baudelaire speculating about Samuel Taylor Coleridge 's restless nocturnal wanderings ; an anxiety-eaten Gurgaon CEO hitting golf balls into the night ; a 9th-century Arab scholar getting his library confiscated . The sketches are reminiscent of Banerjee 's column in these pages , but Doab Dil lacks that earlier whimsy and poesy . In the few pages where his skips over to the world of Digital Dutta , the writing and images come together wonderfully and you know why Banerjee is one of the best in his craft . But that craft is perhaps limited to fiction . There are very few pages that have the multi-panelled layout typical of graphic novels . Instead , the pages themselves are meant to work as panels . Typically , Banerjee 's minimal illustrations are great but there are several full-pages where the reader might feel taken for granted . The shading , deliberate and considered , looks lovely while the crosshatching is largely clumsy . That said , both characters and landscapes never fail to attract curiosity . The real doab dil here is the coming together of Banerjee 's drawings and Sudeep Chaudhuri 's colouring . As Banerjee admits in the introduction , the colouring and production are the real heroes of the book . The cover design is fantastic . The panels in Banerjee 's previous works , characterised by his spare brushwork and sparse colouring , had seemed two-dimensional . In Doab Dil , colours add the much-needed depth . This book is sure get the graphic novel enthusiast 's fingers itchy ."

    "text": "ExoFiT rover voyage \" We make teleoperations as martian as possible , \" explains Juan Delfa , ESA 's robotics engineer overseeing the activities . \" We are continuously working against the clock as you need to take into account signals from Mars take between 4 and 24 minutes to arrive at Earth while blasts of wind might cover the rover 's solar panels with dust , and that we only have a few hours to decide what the rover should do next , \" adds Juan . The campaign started on 18 February and will run until 1 March . This is the first time that ESA 's European Centre for Space Applications and Telecommunications ( ECSAT ) , in Harwell , UK , is acting as a mission control . With over 60 people from different space and scientific organisations involved , \" it is all about getting the teams to practice with real mission issues . We are learning how to teleoperate a rover in the field and to make decisions in the most efficient way , \" says Lester Waugh , ExoFiT mission manager from Airbus . A rover on the field , scientists in the blind The rover is equipped with a set of cameras and proxy instruments , such as a radar , a spectrometer and a drill , to replicate martian operations . As it departed from the ' landing site ' in a remote barren area , the first thing this prototype of ExoMars did was share a panoramic image and its location coordinates with mission control . Scientists in the UK must take decisions on the next steps with the little information they have - a combination of the data transmitted by the rover and satellite images of the terrain . \" We only see what the rover sends us and we can not rely on any other real-time information , \" explains lead mission scientist Matt Balme , a planetary geologist from The Open University . On every martian day , known as sol in the planetary jargon , scientists analyse the data they receive and establish a whole plan for the next day in just a few hours . \" It is a logistical challenge , and the planning cycle is quite stressful , \" says Matt . The ExoFiT teams in the UK set the exploration path and activities for the rover , which travels at a speed of two centimeters per second avoiding rocks and overcoming slopes . Drilling into ancient rocks is an important part of the trial . \" Just like we would do on Mars , we want to understand the geological history of the area and look for signs of life , \" says Matt . ExoFiT stands for ExoMars-like Field Testing , and it is an essential step to improving European robotic operations not only for ExoMars , but also for future missions aiming to return soil from the Red Planet , such as the Mars Sample Return mission ."

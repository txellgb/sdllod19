    "text": "It would be easy to dismiss Lonely Mountains : Downhill as another one of those games that revels in the grisly outcome for failing horribly at the most mundane of tasks . If you 've been keeping tabs of the smaller releases over the past couple of years , you 'll have noticed a kind of niche category ( maybe not quite as definitive as a sub-genre per se ) begin to surface and subsequently trend . The kind of silly , black humor-styled efforts that are often as much about the consequence of failure as they are the attempt at success . No matter how insignificant these tasks may be -- cycling with your young son through perilous death-traps , constructing bridges for vehicles to cross . What these games have in common is an embracing of unforeseen failure , of inevitable death . The nature of needing to start from scratch but knowing that all players want is to simply get back into proceedings , rather than be reminded of their first/tenth/hundredth failure . Failure is inevitable , no way around it . Lonely Mountains follows in that vain of treating physical injury to your player-character as a dismissive affair , common even -- you can just hit restart , respawn and carry on as if nothing 's ever happened , remember ? It 's a video game after all ; who cares how many times you inadvertently force your character to smack head-first into the ground , into a nearby river or somewhere else even less comforting -- a few spurts of pixellated blood shooting up and out your damaged body . Developer Megagon Industries ' crowdfunded mountain-biking offering is n't attempting some weird fusion of light-hearted imagery mixed with darker-leaning tones though , despite the low-poly visuals and clear emphasis on the grueling need to finally , at long last , memorize how not to die like so many times before . As we reported back in May of last year , Lonely Mountains ' appeal extends beyond this playful macabre-lite delivery -- rather than indulging in the ridiculousness of its end result , this is a game that actually takes time to bury detail and subtle little suggestions in amongst its descending paths and treacherous routes alike . The subtle physics and handling of its controls -- which mix up depending on the type of bike you select during the character/track select screen -- are just as prevalent as they were last year , as is the off-kilter and stripped-back use of sound design . Namely with its soundtrack , or lack thereof ; instead , replaced by the ambient chirping of birds , crashing of water and more notably , the dug-in friction of bike wheels braking on the dirt beneath . For a game whose chosen art-style simplifies the environment to rigid shapes , its attention to detail ( for starters ) in the feel and handling of mountain-biking is unexpected at first , but incredibly satisfying the more you begin to unravel Lonely Mountains ' intentions . And I 'm not just talking about its multi-route options , the possibility to veer off the suggested path in pursuit of a short cut that may , or may not , chip a few seconds off your best time . Accomplishing your goal as quickly and as efficiently as possible is still the aim here , but the much more interesting elements to be found -- and those that reinforce the need to revisit its small-if-branching assortment of courses time and time again -- come by way of its actual level design . Picking the game 's environmental courses apart to see if that clearing or breaking away of foliage is indeed a secret route -- an exploit that can be converted into a secret route of sorts ... or is n't anything but inevitable death by way of another , completely separate , hundred foot drop or such . Lonely Mountains goes a great job at balancing this suggestiveness between obscure and outright blatancy . Being as obvious as a literal fork in the path , or cleverly tucking itself behind certain environment details -- even staring you squarely in the face but disguising itself as mere environmental decoration . The game does all this without over-egging the potential hilarity of its fail-states . There 's no goofy or otherwise exerted visuals or animations to denote your failure . Nor is there a hint of silliness or slapstick humor that attempts to budge its way to the forefront , so as to paint Lonely Mountains as a game all about the would-be hilarity of assuming one thing only to be punished shortly thereafter . To ever think you could land your bike after a hundred foot drop without getting the direction/positioning of your bike 's wheels spot on ; the game , surprisingly , decides against indulging in comedy altogether and is all the better because of it . In refusing to parody the physicality and risk of downhill cycling , this withdrawal from the usual repertoire actually works to Lonely Mountains ' advantage -- encouraging players to think more closely about the gameplay components and more importantly , how to get it right . How and where to use the stamina meter to speed up , so as to make that pivotal jump coming up . Or when it might be fruitful to take a sharp bend at a faster speed , albeit at the risk of crashing . All the while , spotting these brief , suggestive but entirely optional short-cuts or would-be short-cuts and thinking , just maybe , it may prove useful to take another risk on top of the ones already administered . Surprising even the developer themselves with what one can spot and find amongst the environment -- one member of the team noting during my play-time , of what speed-runners , having access to an early build , could do with the game 's physics and general design , in achieving rather nifty coverage of the terrain . There 's a quicker/quickest way to progress here , but there 's no right or wrong method in working it all about . To-be-expected walling-off of certain parts aside . But even then , to so willingly push to see how wide and assorted Lonely Mountains ' design really is , stands as the prime reason why Megagon Industries ' clear passion for the sport -- and the thrill of the unpredictability -- translates so well . To not get so caught up in the aftermath and/or exploit it with unnecessary visual effects or amplified suggestion of comedy or humor . Lonely Mountains needs none of this , because its intentions instead , for the better , are in discovering things for yourself rather than being told that a failure here or a failure there is funny . The game is instead a bold and all-the-more involved questioning of the level design put before you . In working out if that slight little hill off the beaten path actually leads down to a secret path off-screen . The agency in discovering secrets , real or not , has been with us since the early days of the NES and Lonely Mountains : Downhill 's gamble with player curiosity clearly calls back to such a timeless trait in game design . As such , it more than pays off , lending itself to a great mix of subtle guidance and tight control-orientated gameplay -- potentially giving Megagon ( due out sometime this Summer ) plenty of favor over their many , similarly-sized peers ."

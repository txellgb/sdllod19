    "text": "Ian Holloway , the only manager to see Leicester City relegated to the third tier of English football , has warned Brendan Rodgers of the regret he has felt since ditching Plymouth mid-way through the 2007/08 season to take the helm at the King Power stadium . The 55-year-old has since called the decision , \" the biggest mistake of my life \" . His switch from Argyle to City is similar to the current situation surrounding Rodgers , especially in terms of the fan outrage seen from Celtic this week . Foxes fans will be hoping that this time it wo n't end in relegation for their club though . Speaking to TalkSport , the Bristol-born manager criticised Rodgers ' decision to complete a move to Leicester , forfeiting the chance to make history by winning a treble treble with Celtic . He suggested that the Northern Irishman should have waited for an offer from Chelsea . \" I left Plymouth and went to Leicester with a third of the season left , \" Holloway said . We got relegated . \" \" Brendan , I thought he would have been that sought after , after the treble treble with Celtic , I hope he does n't regret it . \" Why would n't Chelsea have come in for him in the summer ? \" \" You 've got to think about leaving and you should leave with dignity ."
